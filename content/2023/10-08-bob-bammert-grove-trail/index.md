This afternoon, I was in Olympia and in search of a short, new hike for a bit of exercise. The trail guides pointed me to the Bob Bammert Grove trail and it was just perfect for the occasion.

I couldn't find much about Mr. Bammert or why there's a forest grove named for him, but I enjoyed the experience and a brief glimpse at the sun midway through the loop. It's a short hike, but good exercise. There are some good climbs along the way.
