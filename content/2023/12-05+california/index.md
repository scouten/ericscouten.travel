I went to California this week for a major event for my team at work. 

<!-- more -->

[Coleen's post](https://contentauthenticity.org/blog/cai-symposium-2023) about the event covers it well so I'll let that stand for itself.

My photos here are more about the getting there and back.

On the way down (Monday afternoon), it was a very rainy day at Sea-Tac airport:

I had a few moments on Tuesday evening to walk around downtown San Jose. The cathedral there had arranged for some holiday images to be projected onto its building.

I had a very early flight home on Friday morning. I have grown to kind of love smaller planes (this was a Delta E175), which afforded some great views of the scenery along the way:
