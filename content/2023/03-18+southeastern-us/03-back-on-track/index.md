Fortunately, I was able to get back on track and resume the trip as planned today.

My sweet ride and I got a 70-km / 45-mile ride to Florence in the morning where, thankfully, the right tire was in stock and could be installed. (BTW, if you're wondering how I scored a BMW as a rental, look no further than [Turo](https://turo.com), which you could think of as AirBNB but for cars. I grew tired of the milquetoast selection of vehicles and terrible customer service of the big-name rental companies _cough_ Hertz _cough,_ I'm looking at you.)

This trip is not a vacation for me. I am continuing to work, but more remotely than usual. (Thank you, Adobe, for allowing that!) Given that the flat had caused an intrusion on a day I had planned to work, I high-tailed it to my intended office / AirBNB location in Wilmington once the car was again road-ready. No photos along the way, but I did go for a brief photo walk after hours in the downtown historic district where I am staying.
