Today, I left Wilmington and headed down to Charleston where I connected with Lisa. We'll be in Charleston for the next several days. In both cities, I enjoyed the historic architecture.

(P.S. No travel blog for Day 5. I was on a work-related trip to the Raleigh area and the weather did not encourage much photography.)

Here are a few photos from a walk around Wilmington before I left this morning:
