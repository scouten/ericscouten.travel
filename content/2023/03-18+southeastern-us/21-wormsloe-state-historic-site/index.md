This afternoon, we took a short trip to [Wormsloe State Historic Site](https://gastateparks.org/Wormsloe), the site of the home of one of the first British settlers in what would later become Georgia.

The park is perhaps most notable for the mile-long driveway lined by live oaks. Something like 400 trees were planted along the route, and on a sunny day such as today, they make quite a spectable.

Our original plan had been to stay on Tybee Island from Wednesday afternoon through Saturday. I won't go into the unfortunate details here, but let's just say the home we had rented through AirBNB turned out not to be really ready for guests. We wound up booking a hotel in Savannah at the last minute instead.

We drove through Tybee again this afternoon, but the town was filled to the brim with the Spring Break party/beach scene. We never got out of the car. We feel very relieved to be staying in Savannah instead.
