We left Charleston for points farther south along the coast. We're spending a couple of nights in Hilton Head Island, before embarking on some separate journeys for a little while.

Lisa will be staying here for the weekend, spending some quality time with a close friend who lives here in South Carolina, and I will be doing some fun solo exploration. (I look forward to sharing details over the weekend!)
