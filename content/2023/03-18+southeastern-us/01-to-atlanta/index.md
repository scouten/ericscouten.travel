Here goes a great new adventure! I flew today to Atlanta, Georgia, as part of a grand exploration of the southeastern United States.

<!-- more -->

I'll spend most of this time with my partner, Lisa Rozmyn, but the first few days are mostly solo travel while she and her daughter enjoy some mom:daughter time.

The day started, as many of my days do, in search of coffee. I had spent the night in Seattle's Ballard neighborhood before heading to the airport.

I had a window seat on today's flight, so most of my photos for today are my views looking northward (from the left side of the plane) as we flew across the country.

On final approach to Atlanta, I was treated to a familiar logo.

And here is the view from my hotel in downtown Atlanta:

I have a long drive tomorrow ... hopefully some good photo opportunities along the way!
