We've been spending this week in the already-sultry heat of Savannah, Georgia. It's been around 30°C / 85°F most of the week, which -- for those of us acclimated to Pacific Northwest climate -- is quite enough, thank you.

We hear it gets hotter in the summer. Bleh.

On Sunday morning, I enjoyed one last sunrise on the farm ...

... and then I drove up to Hilton Head Island to reconnect with Lisa. We gave a friend of hers a ride to the Savannah airport and then began our exploration of the city itself.

We did a lot of walking around the city. Here are some random captures from here and there:

This was a [favorite coffee shop](https://perccoffee.com) near where we stayed for part of the week:

Near the coffee shop was what I _thought_ was an abandoned industrial building. Then I started hearing music and other work sounds from inside. Turns out it's the headquarters of [Southern Pine Company](http://www.southernpinecompany.com), which is an active business with an elegant web site that provides reclaimed building materials for construction.

I love that many of the old concrete street signs remain standing.
