It's only March and already it is getting hot and sultry around here. This afternoon, we went out for a small adventure near Charleston: seeing the state park that commemorates the original Charles Town settlement from 1670.

We didn't spend much time in the archeological sites, but we did enjoy the walk through the relatively undeveloped area on the edge of today's city. (The Charles Towne Landing area was settled some time earlier than the heart of today's city because it was easier to defend in the 17th-century military era.)
