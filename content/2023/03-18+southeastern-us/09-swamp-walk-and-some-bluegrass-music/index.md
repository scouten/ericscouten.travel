Some local friends suggested that we visit the [Caw Caw Interpretive Center](https://ccprc.com/53/Caw-Caw-Interpretive-Center), a county-maintained wildlife preserve just outside of Charleston. We did and enjoyed a walk through a cypress swamp and former rice plantation.

I haven't done infrared photography in a very long time, but the contrasts of a hot and humid swamp were too good to pass up.

On a whim, we decided to drive to the coastal town of Rockville, just to see what it was about. Short answer: a very good place to go and be quietly forgotten if that is your wish. Here is the view from where the road ends at the water's edge:

On our way back to Charleston, got what felt like an authentic South Carolina experience. Stopped in for a bite to eat and found live bluegrass/country music on the back patio. Lots of pickle-y things which Lisa enjoyed. Lots of meaty goodness that we both enjoyed.
