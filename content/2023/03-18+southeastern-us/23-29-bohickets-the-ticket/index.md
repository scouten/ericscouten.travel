We've spent this week in and around Charleston, first in Isle of Palms and more recently in another AirBNB on Bohicket Creek on Johns Island.

We don't have a lot to share from Isle of Palms; it's a fairly touristy beach resort community and we've all seen those before.

That, and I was working this week. Not a bad office, though, right?

On Wednesday, we left Isle of Palms and spent the day in Charleston. On our way out, we drove through Sullivan's Island and found this fun access to the beach near the west end of the island:

Since Wednesday afternoon, we've been in a delightful AirBNB on the shore of Bohicket Creek a bit southwest of Charleston. The sunset and sunrise views have been a real treat:

We went a couple nights ago to the [Tattooed Moose](https://tattooedmoose.com/) for drinks and some grub.
