Today marks the end our delightful time together in the Southeast. Today, I drove six hours back to Atlanta and flew another five hours to California. I'll be there for the next several days for some work-related events and a bit of personal travel over the weekend.

My flight departed Atlanta around sunset, so I got a few fun photos from my window seat.
