Today was mostly a work day, but I did get the chance to explore a little bit around downtown while getting lunch and coffee.

This morning it was unusually cold for this time of year here (2°C / 36°F). While walking around downtown this morning, I heard somebody say to her friend: "Oh, it gonna heat up and when it heat up, you gonna know it."

She wasn't kidding. Today's high was 15°C / 59°F. Friday's forecast is 27°C / 80°F.

It gonna heat up.

My afternoon coffee came from this nearby coffee shop with an adorable logo:

It did heat up enough this afternoon that I took most of my afternoon meetings from the patio with this view. (In fact, it heat up enough that I lowered the awning shortly after taking this photo.)

After work, I took a drive to the coast. It was kind of cloudy and blah for a while, and then at _just_ the right moment, the clouds cleared and gave me some really nice sunset views.
