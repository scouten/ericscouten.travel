From yesterday's farm stay on the coast near Townsend, I drove down to Jekyll Island.

But first ... good morning from the coast!

Once on Jekyll Island, I first went to the state park on the north end of the island.

While some parts of the beach were well-occupied, I was able to enjoy some parts largely to myself once I got out a bit further:

Later, I toured the Jekyll Island Historic District, once known as the [Jekyll Island Club](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jekyll_Island_Club), a summer resort and hunting club for some of the country's most famous elites. Today it has been restored and serves as a public resort and historic district.

In the afternoon, I returned to the farm stay and was treated to a late afternoon thunderstorm. I moved many years ago from the Midwest to Washington state. One of the sacrifices from that move was that I rarely experience a good thunderstorm any more. I was happy to have one here.
