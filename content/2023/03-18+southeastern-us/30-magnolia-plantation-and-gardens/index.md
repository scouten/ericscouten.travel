Today is our last full day together on the Southeast. We were expecting clouds and rain but instead got a beautiful sunny day. We decided to visit one more plantation -- the [Magnolia Plantation and Gardens](https://www.magnoliaplantation.com/), located on the Ashley River just outside of Charleston.

The grounds are quite nicely preserved from their replanting as an informal romantic garden centuries ago.

Later in the afternoon, we walked along the Audubon Swamp Garden, a roughly mile-long tour through wetlands rife with heron, egrets, and more alligators:
