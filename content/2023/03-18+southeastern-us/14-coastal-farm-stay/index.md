I found [a last-minute AirBNB room](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/31609261) on a farm in rural Georgia with goats and sheep and chickens and maybe an alligator in the river.

<!-- more -->

I stopped through Savannah for lunch and a brief work stop on the way.

Lisa and I will be spending a few days in Savannah soon. Looking forward to exploring and sharing more!

On my (rather circuitous) route to the farm stay, I stopped through the town of Darien:

One of the benefits of this AirBNB is the free use of their kayaks. Having heard that the resident alligator has been "taken care of" by a neighbor recently, I decided it would be safe to venture forth for a sunset paddle.

{{ es_image(id = "es-4498-059", caption = "Sapelo River, west of Townsend, Georgia") }}

Lots more to explore around here tomorrow. Looking forward to it!
