The AirBNB where we're staying includes the use of kayaks, so I took one out just before sunset tonight.

The photos are a little less technically sound than I'd like. I didn't want to bring the "big" camera gear out in the kayak for fear of getting it splashed. So it was iPhone only and I think I over-zoomed a bit. But, hey, the "creek" (more like a full-on river if you ask me) was pretty, so I'll share anyway.
