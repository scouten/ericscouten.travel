I spent the rest of the weekend in Mendocino and headed back to the Bay Area for a few days of meetings with the rest of [my team](https://contentauthenticity.org).

Yesterday (Sunday) was a foggy and rainy day, so I drove up to [Point Cabrillo Light Station](https://pointcabrillo.org). I took the hiking trail out to the lighthouse and had to laugh at this sign. Good way to encourage people _not_ to take the shortcut from that trail to the lighthouse!

Today (Monday), I drove back to the city. Only a few photos from along the way, but it was a fun and scenic route:
