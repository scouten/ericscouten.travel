Continuing on from my [month-long trip through the Southeastern US](/2023/03-18+southeastern-us/), I spent most of _this_ week representing my team and project at [Internet Identity Workshop](https://internetidentityworkshop.com). IIW is a fabulous torrent of information and connections. Having attended before and had that same experience then, I made plans to have this weekend away and to myself.

After the conference ended yesterday afternoon, I got my rental car and drove to the north end of the Bay Area. I had some nice views across the water to San Francisco, but mostly it was time to start decompressing.

Today's weather was üë©üèº‚Äçüç≥ perfect: cool but sunny. And I had a very fun rental car, so _of course_ I took the windy coastal highway north. I had driven most of this route before, but the aptly named Panoramic Highway was new to me:

Had to laugh and maybe cry a little at this sign. How many people (wrongly) followed their GPS down this private driveway?

Did I mention the lonely, windy roads?

People who know me know that I typically demur when asked what is my favorite ___, including what is my favorite travel destination.

Let the evidence show that Mendocino clearly belongs on a short list of my favorite places because I keep coming back and that is where I am again this weekend. I first set foot in Mendocino more than thirty years ago. I've lost count, but I think I'm now on something like my 15th visit.

Were it not for the modern-day cars parked on its streets, you could think you've stepped back 100 or more years when you in this town. It's quiet and laid-back. Signs at the edge of town refer to the Mendocino Historic Preservation District, and they take this seriously.

Here's a view of the village from across the bay:

I'm here to do a whole lot of nothing, which sounds like just my speed about now.

I've mostly hidden the parked cars behind trees or hills. You see what I mean about being well-preserved history?

Anyway, more in a few days as I continue to revisit this -- dare I say it? favorite -- place.
