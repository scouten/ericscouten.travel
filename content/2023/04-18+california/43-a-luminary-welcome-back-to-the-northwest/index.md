After 43 days on the road, I am happy to be back home. Today's travels took me from San Jose, California, over the Cascades, and to my partner's home in the south Sound.

Farewell, Silicon Valley!

I got a brief glimpse of what I believe are the Three Sisters mountains in central Oregon from my window seat ...

... and an over-the-wing view of Mount Rainier on approach to Sea-Tac.

To all my friends in the Northwest, thank you for arranging this nice bit of weather to welcome me home!

It was [Arts Walk](https://www.artswalkoly.com) weekend in Olympia, and by happy accident, we showed up just in time for the Luminary Procession at nightfall. Lisa tells me this is tiny compared to the Procession of the Species which used to run as part of Arts Walk in pre-COVID days. (I hope that resumes some day.)
