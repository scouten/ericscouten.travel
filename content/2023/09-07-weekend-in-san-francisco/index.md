My fiancé and I took a short trip to San Francisco this weekend. This was partly so I could have a couple of work-related meetings and partly just for fun.

This was a smaller trip for us; we didn't venture out of the city at all. What follows are a few glimpes of our explorations of the Union Square district where we were staying, the Embarcadero, and Pier 39 area.

The Powell Street Cable Car originated very near our hotel, so of _course_ we had to ride it!

We don't know the origin of this building's decorations, but Lisa enjoyed seeing it as the "Mom" building.

My teammate and I selected an appropriate conference room for our meetings on Friday. (No comment on what kind of hell we were raising ...)

As I write this, we are on our flight back to Seattle. I had the left window seat, so I got a couple fun shots of the Bay and Golden Gate Bridges on the way out:

Until next time, California!
