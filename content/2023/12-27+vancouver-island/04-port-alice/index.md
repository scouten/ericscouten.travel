After a few long days on the road, I mostly took a rest today. I drove a relatively short route to Port Alice just to see what it was about and otherwise laid low and kept to myself today.

This sunrise-ish photo was taken at 8:45 this morning (!).

Along the way to Port Alice, I stopped at the Marble River crossing. The waterfall was impressive.

(What you're seeing in this video is rain, not snow.)

There's not a lot to report from Port Alice. It's a town of less than 1000 people and in the winter it's pretty sleepy. There were some moody cloudy views across the Neroutsos Inlet and that was about it.

Tomorrow will be a long day on the road to one last destination on this trip.
