To ring in the New Year, I explored the coast from Tofino down to Ucluelet and back.

I didn't realize it at the time, but I was staying nearby a Kerfuffle Zone. (Gulp!)

This is one way to ensure that people don't block your driveway ...

After coffee, I enjoyed the sunrise from the marina in Tofino.

After this, I drove down to Ucluelet and enjoyed a walk along the Wild Pacific Trail.

Along the way back, I stopped for a quick hike on the Shorepine Bog trail.

By early afternoon, the weather had deterioriated into the stereotypical Pacific Northwest rain and grey, so I went back to Tofino, had a good coffee, and enjoyed a good nap.

Tomorrow I head home.
