Today I drove as far as you can to the north of Vancouver Island. I'm staying tonight and tomorrow night in Port Hardy, a small tourist and fishing village at the end of British Columbia's Highway 19.

This was a day full of fog and mist. Exactly what the Pacific Northwest winter is known for.

From Parksville to Campbell River, there is a choice of a modern expressway or the old two-lane highway. I took the old road for a while, which led to the most fun photos of the day. I stopped here in Fanny Bay to take in a fun foggy seascape.

... and then a funny thing happened. I was focusing on one of the larger boats in the scene when it occurred to me that the look and feel of the boat was ... shall we say ... familiar. When I finally arrived in Port Hardy and started processing my photos, I zoomed in on the name of the boat.

Turns out this is the now-retired _MV Rhododendron,_ formerly of the Washington State Ferry system, now serving as a staging site for a local oyster harvesting operation.

North of Campbell River the weather turned a bit more unpleasant, so I only stopped a couple of times for photos.

Looking forward to laying low and maybe _just a little_ exploring tomorrow.
