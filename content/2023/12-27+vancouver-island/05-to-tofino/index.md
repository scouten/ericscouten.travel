Long, long day on the road today, but the rewards were so worth it!

I started from Port Hardy right around sunrise as the fog was just burning off of Port Hardy's marina:

A half-hour or so down the road, I stopped at Nimpkish Lake to take in more views of the fog and mountains:

Knowing that daylight was short and time was tight, I stayed focused on the road until I hit the turnoff from Parksville to Tofino. And then I couldn't resist. Highway 4 is easily among the most scenic drives I've taken in recent memory. Here are a few highlights from when it was safe to stop:

Happy New Year's to you all!
