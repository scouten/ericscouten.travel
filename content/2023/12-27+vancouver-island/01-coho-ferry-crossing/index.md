I've been to Victoria, British Columbia, many times, but I haven't seen much of Vancouver Island beyond the capitol city. Over the next several days, I'll be "fixing" that -- by exploring the _rest_ of the island.

This afternoon, I took the [Coho Ferry](https://www.cohoferry.com) from Port Angeles to Victoria.

The sun made a rare winter appearance and gave us some nice scenery to contemplate during the 90-minute crossing.

There was some rolling and churning along the way. (That said, I've seen much worse on this route before.)

By the time I cleared Canadian Customs and Victoria's rush hour, there wasn't a lot of daylight left, but I did get a quick shot from a viewpoint along the Malahat Parkway, a bit north of Victoria.

{{ es_cdn_image(id = "es-4622-102", cdn_version = "v1", cdn_key = "img/v1/2023/12/es-4622-102", caption = "Malahat Summit Viewpoint, north of Malahat, British Columbia, Canada") }}

Check back soon. I'm eager to share more of the island with you all over the next few days!
