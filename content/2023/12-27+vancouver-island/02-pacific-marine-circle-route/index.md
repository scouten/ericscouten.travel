Today I did a variation on the [Pacific Marine Circle Route](https://vancouverisland.travel/itineraries/pacific-marine-circle-route/), which is to say that I explored the part of Vancouver Island that is mostly west of Victoria and Nanaimo.

<!-- more -->

I backtracked a bit from Nanaimo so that I could pick up the highway toward the coast from near Duncan. This led me to the east shore of Cowichan Lake, which -- like so much of the Pacific Northwest -- was wrapped in moody fog and low clouds. I got a clear shot of the lake from the town of Youbou.

From there, I took a back road to the coastal town of Port Renfrew. This road is mostly used by logging crews and the _very_ occasional tourist. So occasional that the mobile phone providers don't see fit to provide service here:

(That's 35 miles for my friends back home ...)

Farther along the route, I happened upon Jordan River, where some intrepid surfers were enjoying the waves:

Tomorrow I head much farther north along the island.
