After an extended intermission at home, our summer break road trip has resumed. My daughter and I both spent some time in the San Juan Islands. (See [146 Parks](https://146parks.blog) for some details of my explorations.) Since then, we've headed north into parts of British Columbia neither of us have seen before.

We spent Tuesday night in Vancouver and then did a brief tour of the [VanDusen Botanical Garden](https://www.vandusengarden.org). Someday, I shall endeavor to return for a more thorough photo shoot here,

We spent the next night in Whistler and then headed north to visit friends in Quesnel, which is much farther north than either of us have been before. There were hours and hours of windy roads, but that also meant lots of scenery to enjoy!

An Australian rest area in the middle of British Columbia? Hmmm ...

_(Actually, there's a tiny village called "Australian" where this rest area is located.)_
