One of my favorite things about working at Adobe is the periodic invitation to disconnect from the day-to-day for weeks at a time and recharge. When I first joined, that five-year mark seemed ages away. Tonight I began my fifth sabbatical.

I'm on my way to Salt Lake City for a fun family occasion. Today, after closing up the laptop, I mostly drove freeway miles to get to my first stopping point. I'm now at a long-time favorite hotel in Richland, Washington, the [Lodge at Columbia Point](https://lodgeatcolumbiapoint.com).

Tomorrow the fun explorations begin in earnest. Looking forward to sharing that with you all.

Meanwhile, a few captures from the road as I transitioned from Seattle's fog and rain to central Washington's sun:

This view. It's part of why I keep coming back!
