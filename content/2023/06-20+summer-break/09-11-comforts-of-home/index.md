The _plan_ was to spend a couple of days on the California coast and then work our way up through Crater Lake and Bend, Oregon, before heading home.

We enjoyed a cool and misty drive up the coast. (Both of us enjoy that kind of weather. Weird. I know.)

We spent a night in this _adorable_ watertower cottage ([AirBNB](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/837673892737391150)) near Mendocino, which I highly recommend.

When we left Albion, it was delightfully cool (13°C / 55°F), but as we started over the mountains, it became a whole different story.

We were already thinking of abbreviating the trip, but when the car's thermometer registered 41.5°C / 107°F near Redding, we decided to cut short and head for the comforts of home. Aside from this drive-by photo of Mount Shasta, it was all freeway miles.

Bye for now until our next adventure!
