I'm on my way to Salt Lake City for an important family occasion this weekend. Today's travels took me to Boise by way of a part of Idaho I had not seen before.

Today's route started with a part of the Palouse that I was well familiar with between Richland and Clarkston. Along the way, I got to make progress on my [Washington state parks project](https://146parks.blog/lewis-and-clark-trail/).

Once into Idaho, the route along US 95 and Idaho 55 offered lots of scenery but few safe places to stop for photography. Here are a few that represent the area from today:
