Yesterday, we drove from Reno to Half Moon Bay, California, by way of the south side of Lake Tahoe. Today, we drove back into San Francisco for some shopping and a big-city experience.

My daughter and I are traveling together for this leg of the trip. She had Googled Half Moon Bay and was all excited to take me to dinner at Dad's Luncheonette as a belated Father's Day gift. Sadly, they are only open a few days per week and our days in Half Moon Bay are not among those days.

After our shopping expedition in The City, we took some time for a walk along the coastline at Lands End:
