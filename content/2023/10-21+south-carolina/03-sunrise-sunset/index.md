Keeping it simple today; took the day off from work (as did the most of Adobe) and also from doing much with the camera.

<!-- more -->

Next couple of days I'll be focusing on work, so may not be much until later in the week. Meanwhile, enjoy today's sunrise (as filtered through Spanish moss) and sunset.
