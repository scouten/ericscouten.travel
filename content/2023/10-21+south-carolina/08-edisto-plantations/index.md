We came back from Savannah this morning to spend a bit of time with our friends and also to see a few favorite places near Charleston. We're staying for the next couple nights in an AirBNB in Johns Island. The highlight for today was the rare opportunity to tour some of the historic plantation homes near Edisto Island.

The tour was organized by the [Edisto Island Historic Preservation Society](https://coastalcommunityfoundation.org/edisto-island-historic-preservation-society/). One of the ground rules for the tour was that no photography was allowed inside any of the houses. Outdoor photos, however, were welcomed and here are some from the three plantations we visited:
