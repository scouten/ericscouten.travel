The _plan_ was ... OK, the _hope_ was that there would be a day with fog and low tides while we were in South Carolina so I could come back to Botany Bay and make some of the ethereal photos that this location is famous for.

<!-- more -->

The weather was not a fan of this plan. It was sunny almost the entire time we've been here. Today is the last full day of our trip, so I went anyway. I've already [made the sunny-day, low-tide photos at Botany Bay](/2022/11-28+south-carolina/06-bonus-day-botany-bay/) so I challenged myself to make something new and different this time.

The shorebirds were skittering about in search of some microscopic meal I couldn't identify and they caught my attention. The tide this afternoon was about one foot above low tide, so I decided to play with that theme.

Herewith, a bunch of shorebirds with one foot up:
