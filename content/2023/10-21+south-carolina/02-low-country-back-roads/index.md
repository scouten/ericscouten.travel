Ever get curious to see where a road goes for no good reason whatsoever?

No?

Well, I do. And today I scratched one of those itches.

I saw a little town in the middle of nowhere named Bennett's Point and decided to go check it out. The town itself is not really much to write home about (and thus there are no photos from there), but the Bear Island Game Management along the way was a treat.

Today was mostly about driving some back roads in the low country here in South Carolina.
