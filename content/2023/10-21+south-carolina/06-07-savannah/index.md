We're mostly in South Carolina visiting friends in Edisto Beach, but we're taking some time to explore a bit on our own as well. We've returned for a couple of days to Savannah, Georgia.

This is mostly a "work-cation," but I did get the chance to capture some photos while walking to and from various coffee shops in the historic district.

We are staying at the adorable [Printmaker's Inn](http://printmakersinn.com). There's a fascinating bit of history to the building shown below (which is not the house in which we stayed): It's the oldest building in Savannah -- older by about 40 years than the city itself! Huh? Oh. Right. The house was originally built in Connecticut. In an incredible act of preservation and logistics, the house was dismantled, moved to Savannah, and lovingly reassembled, and is now the core of the Hills house at the Printmaker's Inn. If you're ever in Savannah and enjoy B&Bs situated in historic houses, we recommend this one!

Lisa spent some time in the afternoon on a fossil-hunting tour. While there, she learned about the restoration of the Savannah Riverside Power Plant, which now serves as the core of a Marriott hotel on the river front. They've done a fun job of integrating old power plant fixtures, fossils, and backlit mineral slices in their lobby.
