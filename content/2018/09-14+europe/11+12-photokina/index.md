And now we are at the last stop on this trip.

As a happy BMW owner, it was fun to (accidentally) drive past BMW world headquarters on my way out of Münich.

No other pictures from yesterday, as it was a long day of driving and I needed to make time.

This morning I walked the halls of the epic [Photokina](https://www.photokina.com) convention, where vendors were keen to show off all things photographic. It was delightfully overwhelming. Here are a few random photos from around the show floor:

After the show, I took a little time to drive around Cologne before settling in for the evening.

**2023 Update:** Sadly, it looks like this may well have been the last Photokina ever held. For the 2010s, Photokina exhibitions were held on an every-other-year basis. The next one would have been in the fall of 2020 and of course had to be canceled due to the pandemic. The show organizers have since posted a note stating that they have suspended the exhibition "for the time being." It is warmly remembered.
