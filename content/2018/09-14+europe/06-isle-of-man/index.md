Farewell, Dublin. Hello, Isle of Man.

I left Dublin this morning and flew to the Isle of Man, which is in the Irish Sea between Dublin and Liverpool.

<!-- more -->


Good news: I drove over 160 km / 100 miles across the island and the picture-taking was amazing.

Bad news: I was up very early this morning (curse you, insomnia!), so I don’t have a lot of energy left for writing after editing photos. They shall have to speak for themselves tonight.
