Farewell, Dublin. Hello, Isle of Man.

I left Dublin this morning and flew to the Isle of Man, which is in the Irish Sea between Dublin and Liverpool.

<!-- more -->

Good news: I drove over 160 km / 100 miles across the island and the picture-taking was amazing.

Bad news: I was up very early this morning (curse you, insomnia!), so I don’t have a lot of energy left for writing after editing photos. They shall have to speak for themselves tonight.

A funny story from this morning's travels, as described at the time on Facebook:

It's going to be one of _those_ days, I see.

Had a moment of panic that I had left my laptop somewhere in the airport terminal.

Looked around for a moment and found it quickly.

On my lap.

This is what happens when you wake up three hours ahead of your alarm.
