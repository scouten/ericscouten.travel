Borders fascinate me. Always have.

I spotted a point on the map where a road follows a relatively straight line across a national border between Ireland and the United Kingdom that is anything but straight.

So, of course, I had to go.

Road geek here ...

This is the only sign at the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland. No "Welcome to the United Kingdom," no "Northern Ireland."

Just ... speed limits are different here.

And the return to Ireland is even more understated:

{{ es_image(id = "es-3795-011", title = "Unperfected", caption = "south of Magheraveely, Northern Ireland, United Kingdom") }}

Aside from the road geekery and a few great photos, I also was rewarded with some driving adventures.

The remnants of Hurricane Helene blew through and generated quite a windstorm here this morning. There were several trees of this size down across the road. Fortunately, I was able to make it back to Dublin safely.

Behind the tree is a warning sign for a speed camera. Not particularly relevant today ...
