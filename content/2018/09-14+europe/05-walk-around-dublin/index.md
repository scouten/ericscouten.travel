A friend of mine from the States happened to be in Dublin at the same time so the two of us went for a very long walk around Dublin this afternoon.

Here are a few random scenes from our walkabout:

{{ es_image(id = "es-3800-019", caption = "Dublin, Ireland") }}

{{ es_image(id = "es-3800-022", caption = "Dublin, Ireland") }}

{{ es_image(id = "es-3800-023", caption = "Dublin, Ireland") }}

{{ es_image(id = "es-3800-024", caption = "Dublin, Ireland") }}

{{ es_image(id = "es-3800-026", caption = "Dublin, Ireland") }}

{{ es_image(id = "es-3800-034", caption = "Dublin, Ireland") }}

Overheard (in a pub): "Ah, gosh, ya got the schnipps there, Paddy!"

(Overheards are a little different here than on Bainbridge!)
