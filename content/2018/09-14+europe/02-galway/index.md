I drove to Galway this morning to visit a friend.

<!-- more -->

It's just over two hours from Dublin to Galway; I got up early and headed west. After a good visit, I took the old road for part of the way back to Dublin. That's where I made my feature image for today. (There’s another one that I’m looking forward to processing, but that will have to wait for another day.)

Back in Dublin, a friend mentioned to me a sad song by Nanci Griffith, [_On Grafton Street_](https://open.spotify.com/track/4jzpItXEaJHll08zwQs7dC?si=2d31bc4a960d4d98), and wondered if it was near me. As it turns out, it's only a few minutes' walk away so I checked it out this evening. It's been converted into a pedestrian mall and it was thriving when I went through at 6pm. I may head back there soon to see what the night scene is like.
