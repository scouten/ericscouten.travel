Four hours on a ferry.

<!-- more -->

Which isn't really so bad, if the ferry is large enough and the winds are small enough.

Very fortunately, both things were true for me today.

I took the ferry from Poole, England (on the south coast) to Saint Peter on the island of Guernsey and then on to Jersey.

That's quite the wake! At the time I clocked us going 60 km/h / 32 knots across the water.

Here are a few photos of Guernsey. I wasn't allowed to disembark the ferry, so these photos are what I could see from port.

Maybe someday I'll be back to explore the Channel Islands in more detail. I especially regret that I couldn't make time to spend on Guernsey. On the other hand, I now know that I'd want to make time for a day trip to nearby Sark, so if/when I do return to Guernsey, I;ll be better prepared.

And now my first views of Jersey:

Once off board, I took the car and did a little exploration of the island before sundown.

{{ es_image(id = "es-3811-185", caption = "L’Étacq, Jersey, United Kingdom") }}

I am about to head off to sleep; I have the sound of waves hitting the beach to warm my soul tonight.

Tomorrow I'll have most of the day to continue exploring Jersey and then I'm off to new places.

Life is good.
