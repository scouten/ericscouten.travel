Itâ€™s 9:45 on a Monday evening as I write this.

Iâ€™m in a pub on Patrick Street, just 15 minutes by foot from where Iâ€™m staying this week. There is live music. The pub is alive with conversation. The music is good.

I flew overnight from Newark to Dublin ...

... and landed in this fun little AirBNB right in the heart of things.

I took a brief drive up the coast from Dublin.

Earlier this afternoon, returning from an earlier walkabout, I happened upon two artists dancing on the side of a building.

{{ es_vimeo(id = "es-3788-097", vmid = "839590972", caption = "Dancing in mid-air. Â· Dublin, Ireland") }}

This is what I came here for.

On my way here, the sidewalks were crowded. People waited in line to get into other pubs.

Couples made out on the sidewalks of side streets. Even the main streets.

Nobody cares that itâ€™s cool and windy here. Itâ€™s always cool and breezy here. Lots of people eat outside even so.

The soft, tangy lilt of the Irish accent is tantalizing. I am smitten hourly by nothing more than voice.

The bartender switches off the football (sorry ... soccer!) game so those of us with an obstructed view of the musicians can see more clearly.

{{ es_vimeo(id = "es-3790-006", vmid = "839591005", caption = "Music on a Monday night. ðŸ’• Â· Dublin, Ireland") }}

Iâ€™ll be in Dublin this week, working and taking little side trips as I can.
