Today I explored into Northern Ireland again.

<!-- more -->

I had attempted to drive to Belfast on my trip last summer, but circumstances prevented that.

So I tried again today. No photos today aside from me being goofy with a statue; the city didnâ€™t inspire me and the weather turned rainy and blustery on the way back.

Tomorrow is my last full day in Ireland. New locations await starting this weekend.
