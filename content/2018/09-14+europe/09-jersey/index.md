I spent about 24 hours exploring the island of Jersey.

<!-- more -->

24 hours is never enough time to truly explore a place, but, in the scheme of a busy, nomadic trip, it was what I had and I'm thankful for the time I had on Jersey.

I woke up early this morning and spent most of the day driving around the island.

I especially enjoyed my time at [Mont Orgueil Castle](https://www.jerseyheritage.org/visit/places-to-visit/mont-orgueil-castle/), which was built starting in 1204 and much more recently opened to the public as a historical site.

This was some of the most adventurous driving I've encountered anywhere. Jersey's roads are _narrow._ Let's just say there were many impromptu lessons in on-the-fly calculations of how wide my car was compared to how wide the available space was. Fortunately, I aced the test.

After a day full of driving, it was time to bid farewell to Jersey and move along to other locations.

I am in London tonight for a quick overnight. I will be moving on to Germany for the remainder of this trip.
