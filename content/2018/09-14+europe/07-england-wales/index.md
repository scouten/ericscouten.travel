Today I left Isle of Man and made my way through the English and Welsh countryside.

<!-- more -->

It was an ambitious trip; made more so by some delays at Liverpool's airport. (All worked out fine in the end ...)

Tomorrow, a long ferry ride and one last new place. For tonight, here are some highlight's from the flight into Liverpool and today’s rural drive.
