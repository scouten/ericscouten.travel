As planned, I finished my circumnavigation of the island and headed back home today.

One last morning view from my hotel over the city of Kaohsiung:

Taiwanese infrastructure, especially on the west coast, is stunningly elaborate. Elevated freeways and train lines for miles and miles, tunnels to avoid even the slightest of climbs or curves, and a matching rail system.

These freeways could have taken me all the way back to Taipei, but I chose to explore some back roads instead.

A few (okay, more than a few) windy turns and switchbacks later, I was well into the lakes-and-mountain region.

I got caught for a little while in a crazy heavy rainstorm.

This sign offered the sales pitch: "17 kilometers (11 miles) of splendid coastline."

The reality was a concrete and industrial dystopia.

I went back to the expressways for a while to clear my head. Decided on one last coastal back-road adventure before I got to the airport.
