I'm spending the today and the next two days exploring the island nation of Taiwan.

<!-- more -->

Why? Well, hmmm ... that's interesting. I have a major birthday this weekend and I decided to give myself the gift of a [new country visited](/countries/). I didn't want to spend a lot of time away (I'm saving my vacation time for later in the year) and the list of _new_ countries I could visit via non-stop flight from Seattle is relatively short. Of those, Taiwan seemed most viable for a long-weekend trip, so here I am!

I flew [EVA Air](https://www.evaair.com). If their goal was to get me to pay attention to the safety video in the middle of the night, kudos to whoever chose the interpretive dance approach:

We landed around 5:30am at Taipei's airport and not much was open, notably not the rental car agency. At least at 6:00, I could get a familiar cup of coffee:

I chose to head out from the city straight away. Over the mountains and to the hotel I had booked on the eastern shore. This led to some very fun and windy rural roads. It was still early enough that the fog hadn't burned off yet:

Today's exploration included a brief tour of [Taroko National Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taroko_National_Park), rich with waterfalls and stunning mountainscapes. Facing a bit of jet lag, I decided to keep my exploration brief today and come back tomorrow.

I got to my hotel early and, after unpacking a bit, I was looking forward to going through today's photos. That's when I made a rather unfortunate discovery:

_I had forgotten to pack the power adapter for my laptop._

Uh oh.

I went to the hotel's front desk to ask for advice. And there is where the adventure began.

It turns out that Hualien City doesn't have any of the big-box electronics stores that we know from the US.

So, instead, I was encouraged to drive downtown (about 30km / 20 miles away), go to a particular intersection downtown, and there I would find a little mom-and-pop electronics store who might have the power adapter I needed. Oh, and I should go soon, because they won't stay open late.

This is that corner. After a valient attempt at working through the language barriers, I learned that they didn't have what I needed. But maybe this other store a block away might?

Still having not found the power adapter I needed, I did find it amusing to see the English words "Mr. Goose" amongst all the Chinese (which I can't read).

{{ es_image(id = "es-3708-038", title = "Mr. Goose", caption = "Hualien City, Taiwan") }}

The almost-but-not-quite what I need routine went on for a while.

I started getting really good at using Google Translate to describe the exact nuances of the power adapter I needed.

I'm happy to report that at the 11th store that I finally found the adapter I needed. And a few spare memory cards for my camera, too!

... and thus began the editing of photos.

While working on my photos just after dark, I heard this sing-song-y tune driving by. In the US, we might think the ice-cream truck is driving by. But ... no. This is the garbage truck.

With that sweet lullaby, I shall bid adieu for tonight and share more adventures tomorrow!
