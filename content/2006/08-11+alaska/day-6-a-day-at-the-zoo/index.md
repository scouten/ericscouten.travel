While back in Anchorage yesterday, we took a little time to go visit the [Alaska Zoo](http://www.alaskazoo.org). This was mostly for fun, but we did manage to capture a few interesting images along the way. I experimented a bit with split-tone processing in Lightroom with these two images. I'd love to hear what you think of it.

Larger versions of these images can be found in the ~~Alaska '06 set on my Flickr account.~~
