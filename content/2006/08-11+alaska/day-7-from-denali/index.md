Yesterday, we drove halfway up to Denali National Park and stayed at the beautiful [McKinley Princess Lodge](http://www.princesslodges.com/mckinley_lodge.cfm) at Trapper Creek. Today, we finished the drive and are staying at the also-beautiful (Denali Princess Lodge)[http://www.princesslodges.com/denali_lodge.cfm]. Sadly, we have no stunning images of the mountain to share yet. She has been hiding behind a veil of clouds all day yesterday and today. As we approach evening time, things are starting to get a bit brighter, so we hold out some hope of getting a view of the mountain.

For now I'll share one more image from the Alaska Zoo ... a musk ox giving us a contemplative stare.

_(where is the musk ox pic?)_
