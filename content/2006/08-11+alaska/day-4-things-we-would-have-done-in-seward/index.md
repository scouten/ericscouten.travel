Anyone who travels much knows that anytime you leave a place, you leave behind a list of things you would have liked to have done there if you had had more time, or known about them earlier.

Having just left Seward, I figured I'd share my list:

* Stayed at the [cabins on Resurrection Bay](http://www.ididaride.com).
* Visited the [Alaska SeaLife Center](http://www.alaskasealife.org).
* Taken a [sled dog ride](http://www.ididaride.com). Apparently, you can even do this in the summer. Who knew?
* Stayed at the [Alaska Saltwater Lodge](http://alaskasaltwaterlodge.com/index.html). These are the same folks who organized the sightseeting tour that we attended. They were sold out by the time we were arranging our trip and kindly referred us to the [Bear Creek Cabins](http://sewardbearcreekcabins.com) where we stayed. (See [my review of Bear Creek Cabins](../day-4-seward-bear-creek-cabins).)
