We have been back from Alaska now for a few days. Getting caught up on the various household responsibilities took priority for most of this week, so I'm just now getting caught up on pictures and blogging. I've posted a few new pictures on ~~my Flickr account~~, including one of my personal favorites that I call Hide and Seek:

Sadly, those same clouds prevented me from getting a clear view of the big peak of Denali.
