We are just now back from a couple of days in Seward, Alaska, where we mostly kept to ourselves, did some sightseeing, and had a wonderful time.

We stayed at the [Seward Bear Creek Cabins](http://www.sewardbearcreekcabins.com), which we highly recommend. This small resort just opened this year, and they're off to a very good start. They've built four small cabins in the woods. Our read of the guest book suggests that some recent guests were able to see bear in the area; we were not so lucky. In fact, our trip has been surprisingly devoid of wildlife so far. But back to the cabins ...

We were a little nervous as we drove to the cabins, considering that they're near a trailer park that's best described as sketchy, but the cabins themselves were very well appointed and the only noise we heard both nights were the quiet comings and goings of our fellow guests and the rustling of the trees in the wind. We were pleasantly surprised to find wireless internet available to us. I have a MacBook Pro, and the titanium-cased Macs are [notorious for weak WiFi reception](http://www.macworld.com/2006/02/reviews/mbpromain/index.php). Inside the cabin, it simply wouldn't connect, so my WiFi sessions were conducted exclusively out on the porch.

(Advice to fellow Mac-toting visitors who choose to stay here: Ask for the #1 or #2 cabin. They're closer to the office, where I presume the wireless receiver is located. The #4 cabin, where we stayed, is at the far end of the property.)

We also went on a nice sightseeing cruise, and I'll blog about that a bit later.
