Last night's news was full of stories about how [security lines had became much worse](http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/traveloutdoors/2003192419_webtravel11.html) with yesterday's terrorist scares. The TV news showed lines of people stretching as far as the eye could see.

Dutifully, we heeded the advice to show up three hours ahead of our flight time -- and breezed through security in about umm ... two minutes. Good news: Lots of time for lunch. Bad news: Lunch done. Still lots of time.

We're now in Anchorage. Tonight was mostly getting our feet on the ground, getting food, and settling in for the evening. Tomorrow, we'll poke around Anchorage a little more (some shops looked interesting, but were closed already) and then head down to Seward. I don't know what the Internet situation will be for us where we're staying in Seward, so you may not hear from us for a couple of days.
