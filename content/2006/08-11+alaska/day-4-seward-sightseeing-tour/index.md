Yesterday, we went on a wildlife sightseeing tour conducted by [Alaska Saltwater Adventures](http://www.alaskasaltwaterlodge.com/alaska_whale_watching.htm). We were fortunate to have great weather and great guides. We were out of season for whales, but we did get a chance to see some other wildlife and scenery.

Barely out of harbor, we were graced with the presence of a bald eagle on one of the dock structures at very close range. Later in the day we saw a few Steller sea lions sunning themselves on the rocks, a few puffins. More pictures are posted on my ~~Flickr account in the Alaska '06 set.~~
