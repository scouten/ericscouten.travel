When Lisa and I met almost five years ago, doing big travel adventures was one of the things we most wanted to do together. We've had some excellent adventures together, but they have all been in North America. (OK, there was [that one excellent adventure in Puerto Rico](2021/12-25+puerto-rico/) early on ...)

We've just completed the first leg of our biggest travel adventure as a couple. I'm so very thankful for this partner, not just for travel but for life as a whole.

It's a very long way from Seattle to Cape Town. Much of the journey was overnight, but I did manage to get a few photos during our final approach to Cape Town. Conveniently this was around sunset tonight!

Aside from today's post, I'm going to give myself the gift of enjoying the trip in the moment while we're here. There will be more travel blog posts, but they will appear after we're back in the States in a couple weeks.
