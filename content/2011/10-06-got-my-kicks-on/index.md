I'm in Las Vegas for a few days for a conference. I had a day off so I got my kicks on Route 66 today.

<!-- more -->

I also got some pics on Route 66, too ... ðŸ™‚

The part from Kingman to Oatman is an intense drive. The speed limit 20 for quite a while, and I suspect most the tickets are written posthumously.

## Update from 2025

As I'm revisiting old social media posts from the time, I have to share one comment from a friend who had also driven the Kingman to Oatman stretch. He said at the time, "I have only rarely suffered the odd fatal injury." ðŸ¤£
