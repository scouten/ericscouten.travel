Today we roadtripped through the Northland region (i.e. the peninsula north of Auckland). It rained much of the day, so we mostly contented ourselves with finding interesting shops in some of the towns we visited.

As fortune would have it, we missed a turnoff and wound up passing this old farmhouse that caught our eye. It captured the mood of mid-afternoon storms quite nicely.
