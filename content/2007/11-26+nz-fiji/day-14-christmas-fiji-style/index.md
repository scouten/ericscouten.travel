Having grown up in the frigid winters of Northern Minnesota, it's sort of odd to experience the Christmas season with temperatures hovering around 90Â°. But there it was, the wait-staff at our resort running around in short sleeves and Santa hats. (Please note: It's quite common for men in Fiji to wear skirts.)
