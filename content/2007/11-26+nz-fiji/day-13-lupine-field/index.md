Today, we returned from the South Island for one last night in Auckland before we leave New Zealand. Not much time for shooting today, so we're posting another photo from yesterday's trip over to Milford Sound.

We'll be taking the next few days to simply relax on the beach in Fiji before returning home. It's possible the photoblog may take those few days off as well.
