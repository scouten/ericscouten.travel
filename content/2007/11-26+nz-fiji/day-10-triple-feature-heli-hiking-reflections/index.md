Today was a day full of adventure. We went heli-hiking on Franz Josef Glacier. This was my first time on a glacier and Tara's first time on a helicopter. She went from terrified of helicopters (having ~~chickened~~ _opted_ out of an opportunity to fly in Hawaii a few years ago) to absolutely loving chopper flight.

We couldn't decide which of today's photos we liked best, so we'll send you all a triple feature today: First is a reflection in a glacial pool. Second is Tara and me on our return flight from the glacier. And finally, a reflection of the Southern Alps from another day hike we took later in the afternoon.
