This beach is known as Hotwater Beach because, at low tide, you can carve out your own personal spa from the sand fed by geothermal activity. Unfortunately, we got some wrong information about when low tide would be happening, so we turned up at _high_ tide instead. It was a nice day at the beach anyway.
