The _plan_ was to go out and see a bunch of parks for the [146 Parks](https://146parks.blog) project, but alas, many of the parks in Central Washington are not really in their prime this time of year.

<!-- more -->

I got one good park visit: [Wenatchee Confluence](https://146parks.blog/wenatchee-confluence/), a good long contemplative drive to myself, and a few random photos along the way.

I'll come back for the other parks sometime in the summer ...
