## Cotton Court Hotel

I have a thing for well-decorated boutique hotels, and I found the delightful [Cotton Court Hotel](https://www.cottoncourthotel.com) in Lubbock for my first night. It's newly built, but they carried a historically-influenced style off with aplomb. I doubt my travels will ever take me through Lubbock again, but I know where I'd stay if they do:
