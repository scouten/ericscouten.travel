This was a more quiet day. Few photos. I was ready to be home.

<!-- more -->

It ended at my favorite place to stay in central Washington: [The Lodge at Columbia Point](https://lodgeatcolumbiapoint.com) in Richland, Washington.

I took no photos on the final day home, so this will be the last post in this series.
