Leaving Lubbock, I decided to continue satisfying my Panhandle curiosity. I drove north through Amarillo and into the far western edge of Oklahoma's Panhandle before turning west to my destination for the night, Taos, New Mexico.

While driving along I-27, I noticed a sign for Palo Duro Canyon State Park, so I took a small detour to check it out. I was rewarded with this panoramic view:

If you squint real hard, you can see a mountain in the distance. (I got to those later that day ...)
