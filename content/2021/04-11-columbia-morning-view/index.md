I woke up at 3:30 this morning to get to a sunrise shoot at [Columbia Hills Historical State Park](https://146parks.blog/columbia-hills/). As dusk rose over the Columbia Gorge, I had to stop for a moment and capture this view along the way.

Later, I went for one more hike in [Beacon Rock State Park](https://146parks.blog/beacon-rock/) and then returned home.
