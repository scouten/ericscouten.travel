Happy New Year! Today, we drove down to the southwesternmost point of Puerto Rico to see Cabo Rojo and its lighthouse, [Faro Los Morrillos](https://www.discoverpuertorico.com/profile/faro-los-morrillos-de-cabo-rojo/8058).

It was very hot this afternoon (31°C / 88°F – _¡hacia mucho calor!_), so we retreated back to the treehouse, where it was shady and we could nap a bit.

Later we met the property owners, Matt and Janine, who gave us a very nice tour of the grounds and talked through their history of buying the property and building the treehouses (three as of our visit!).
