The road into and out of Rojo Cabo is ... a bit difficult. It took us 10 minutes to drive the last 1.2 km / ¾ mile into the park area. Here's why:

It was very hot this afternoon (31°C / 88°F – _¡hacia mucho calor!_), so we retreated back to the treehouse, where it was shady and we could nap a bit.

Later we met the property owners, Matt and Janine, who gave us a very nice tour of the grounds and talked through their history of buying the property and building the treehouses (three as of our visit!).
