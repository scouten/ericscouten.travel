We left Salinas this morning and drove through the mountains to the town of Utuado and then on to a most amazing treehouse near San Germán, where we will spend the last two evenings of our trip.

The road through the mountains was more than a little windy!

No, really, Utuado seniors, what do you think about that pandemic?

Sorry for the wind noise, but this is a brief sample of driving through rural Puerto Rico. Not to worry, Lisa was driving while I made this video!

And then we arrived at the open-air [Treehouse of the Royal Palm](https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/33345310). It was absolutely magical!

As night fell, we enjoyed the jungle sounds, wild and otherwise. (This was New Year's Eve, after all, so there were lots of fireworks and other celebrations happening nearby this night.)
