We left San Juan this morning, rented a car, and explored the tropical rain forest in El Yunque National Forest.

Today's highlight was the hike up the trail to [the tower at Mount Britton](https://www.discoverpuertorico.com/profile/mt-britton-tower/8053).

Once we got to the top, the view _would_ have been amazing but for the wind and clouds ...

Thankfully, some sky poked through before we headed back down the hill:

On our way out of the park, we explored the once-popular bathing grounds at [El Baño Grande](https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/elyunque/recarea/?recid=43413). The swimming grounds were closed in 1968 and transitioned to a tourist site:

Our final visit as we departed was at the [Yokahú Tower](https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/elyunque/recarea/?recid=43389).

After leaving the park, we drove to Salinas where we spent the night at [Marina de Salinas](https://www.marinadesalinas.com). The restaurant offered nice water views and good food, but the room was shall we say ... minimally ... furnished.
