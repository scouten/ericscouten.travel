So excited to start my first major vacation in ... yeah, that long ... and to share it with fellow travel aficionado and sweetheart Lisa Rozmyn.

We started flying at midnight on Christmas eve / morning and landed a bit before Puerto Rico's sunset. We enjoyed a brief walk on the beach ...

... before heading for dinner at [Condal](https://www.yelp.com/biz/condal-san-juan-2), a tapas bar and restaurant in the nearby Condado neighborhood.

Paella, pictured below, was the highlight of our meal.

We spent our first two nights at the [Trópica Beach Hotel](https://tropicapr.com), which isn't quite _on_ the beach, but is an easy walk and was a good place for us to recover from the odd hours and time-zone shifts associated with long-distance travel.

I have no idea what to call these vehicles, but we saw a lot of them. Usually (sadly) accompanied by very loud music.

Puerto Ricans enjoy their outdoor life. As we were walking home from dinner, we found this park where families were out enjoying (non-screen) time together at 9pm, well after sunset.

A short walk along the beach led us to [Numero Uno Beach House](https://numerounobeachhouse.com), which became our go-to spot for mid-day laziness. We watched people enjoying the beach from bean-bag chairs planted on the sand, had tasty drinks and food, and did a whole lot of nothing. Most of these photos are from Day 3 while we waited out the difference between 11am checkout and 3pm checkin at our next venue.
