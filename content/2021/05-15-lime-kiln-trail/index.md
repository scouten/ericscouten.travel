I hiked the Lime Kiln Trail, east of Granite Falls, in mid-May.

<!-- more -->

This popular trail mostly follows an old railroad grade that was used for mining something like 100 years ago.

A few miles in to the trail, you can see the remains of the kiln that had been used to produce lime for nearby construction projects.
