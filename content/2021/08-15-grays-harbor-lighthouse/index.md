My partner and I visited the Grays Harbor Lighthouse in Westport recently.

Funny story: We _thought_ we were checking out [Westport Light State Park](https://parks.state.wa.us/284/Westport-Light) for the [146 Parks](https://146parks.blog) project. Turns out the lighthouse is not part of the park, so I can't count this as a park visit. We'll have to return some other time.

Meanwhile, it was fun to tour the lighthouse.

I am prone to vertigo, so I had to turn back midway up. A few more photos from the top, courtesy of Lisa Rozmyn.
