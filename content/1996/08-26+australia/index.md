I made a friend from the Mac software development community recently and he had a wild idea: "Why don't you come visit me for a while?"

<!-- more -->

Never mind that Peter lives 17,000 km / 10,500 miles away from me. Literally on the other side of the world.

Of _course_ I went!

So I've been hanging out in Western Australia for most of the past month, working half-time remotely from my friend's house in Perth and exploring when I could. Here's some of what I saw from my road trips across Western Australia:

{{ es_cdn_image(id = "es-0186-014", cdn_version = "v1", cdn_key = "img/v1/1996/08/es-0186-014", caption = "Pinnacles, Nambung National Park, Western Australia") }}

{{ es_cdn_image(id = "es-0188-024", cdn_version = "v1", cdn_key = "img/v1/1996/08/es-0188-024", caption = "Moora, Western Australia") }}

Here's a road sign we don't see back home!

{{ es_cdn_image(id = "es-0201-035", cdn_version = "v1", cdn_key = "img/v1/1996/09/es-0201-035", caption = "Port Beach, Fremantle, Western Australia") }}

Funny thing: When Peter drove me to the airport at the end of my time here, he said, "You know, Eric, I've lived here for 20 years and I think you've seen more of Western Australia than I have."

After my time in Perth, I stopped for a few days to visit a college buddy who had moved to Brisbane. One evening, I drove out to Noosa Head National Park, a few hours north of Brisbane. I got there just at sunset and caught this photo looking back across the Pacific to the mainland.

This has been my first big international trip and I love, love, love it! Can't wait to see more of the world!
