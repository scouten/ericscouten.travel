I'm so excited to finally visit Hawaii. One more and I'll have visited all fifty states!

<!-- more -->

A co-worker lives here and I was able to spend the last week working with him and exploring his island of Kaua'i.

We'll start this exploration with the "Grand Canyon of the West," so called because it bears a strong resemblance to the famous canyon in Arizona:

At the end of the Kokee Road is a [hiking trail](https://dlnr.hawaii.gov/dsp/hiking/kauai/pihea-trail/) that gives you this amazing view over the Na Pali Coast, used for some of the opening scenes of the movie _Jurassic Park._

{{ es_cdn_image(id = "es-0175-009", cdn_version = "v1", cdn_key = "img/v1/1996/08/es-0175-009", caption = "Pihea Trail, Na Pali Coast, Kaua’i, Hawaii") }}

{{ es_cdn_image(id = "es-0175-010", cdn_version = "v1", cdn_key = "img/v1/1996/08/es-0175-010", caption = "Pihea Trail, Na Pali Coast, Kaua’i, Hawaii") }}

Sunset along the southwestern coast of Kaua’i. On the left, you can see the shadow of Hawaii’s westernmost island.

{{ es_cdn_image(id = "es-0179-004", cdn_version = "v1", cdn_key = "img/v1/1996/08/es-0179-004", caption = "Sailboats sit in silhouette as the sun sets over Hanalei Bay. · Hanalei, Hawaii") }}

I'm back on the main island of O'ahu now, awaiting travel to my next grand adventure!

{{ es_cdn_image(id = "es-0181-003", cdn_version = "v1", cdn_key = "img/v1/1996/08/es-0181-003", caption = "Nanakuli, O’ahu, Hawaii") }}

**Note from the future:** This photo, captured on the east shore of O'ahu, became the inspiration for the logo I use on this site and many other places.
