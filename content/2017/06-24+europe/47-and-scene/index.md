I write this from the comfort of my own home early on the morning after returning (jet lag, y'know?).

This was, all in all, a trip I greatly enjoyed. Perhaps at some point I'll pull together some thoughts and some favorite photos and places. For now, I just wanted to close out the daily blogs with an appreciation to everyone who played a part in this grand journey -- family, friends, and especially those who helped along the way when things got a little crazy.
