If I had it to do over again, I would have spent more time in the valley between Brașov and Câmpina. By the time I got there, it was getting later than I wanted it to be, but I will remember it well. Next time, right?

Ohai, Fiskars! It was just a few days ago that I was in [Fiskars, Finland](/2017/06-24+europe/28-hanko-and-fiskars/), for which the brand of scissors and garden tools are named.

Starting this evening, I will be traveling with my dear friend [Keron Psillas](http://www.keronpsillas.com/), who is a fantastic photographer and photographic instructor. If you're not familiar with her work, I encourage you to take a look.
