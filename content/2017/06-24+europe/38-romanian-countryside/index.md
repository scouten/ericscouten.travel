Today I took a long drive through the Romanian countryside.

I especially enjoyed the mountain regions and small rural villages. Here's a sampling of what I saw today.

For some reason this cracks me up: This morning I was driving on a 130 km/h (81 mph) expressway. There was a guy standing on the side of the road making sure his goats didn't stray onto the roadway. **(2023 Update: My cousin, an insufferable punster like me, asked at the time if I was on the "autobaaaan." ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è)**

If I had it to do over again, I would have spent more time in the valley between Bra»ôov and C√¢mpina. By the time I got there, it was getting later than I wanted it to be, but I will remember it well. Next time, right?

Ohai, Fiskars! It was just a few days ago that I was in [Fiskars, Finland](/2017/06-24+europe/28-hanko-and-fiskars/), for which the brand of scissors and garden tools are named.

Starting this evening, I will be traveling with my dear friend [Keron Psillas](http://www.keronpsillas.com/), who is a fantastic photographer and photographic instructor. If you're not familiar with her work, I encourage you to take a look.
