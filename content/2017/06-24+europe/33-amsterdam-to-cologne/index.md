I've spent most of the last 24 hours saying "How could you not love this?" to myself. 

Amsterdam was at its best: perfect weather, everyone out and enjoying the canals and the caf√©s. 

Alas, it was time to move on. This afternoon I took the train to Cologne.

Once I had arrived and checked in, I had the chance to catch up with good friends who I haven't seen in a long time this evening.

After we were done and they headed home, I took some time to walk through Cologne's main cathedral and made a few photos there.
