This morning, we welcomed my wife Tara into the trip.

<!-- more -->

Travel is hard for her; she has become an increasingly nervous flyer in recent years. Despite that, she braved not one but two flights yesterday and this morning to make her way from Seattle to Dublin. We’ll be together as a family for roughly a week each in Ireland and Norway and then I will continue solo for some time after that.

Today’s agenda was getting to the airport in the morning to pick her up and then giving her some space to rest and recover in the afternoon. After that, she spent some time with our daughter while I went on a walking tour of central Dublin.
