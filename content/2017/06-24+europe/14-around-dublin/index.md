Today it was mostly sunny here in Dublin, so we took a city tour on one of those infamous double-decker buses.

They were very popular today. After that we drove to the waterfront village of Howth, which is out on a peninsula north of Dublin center city.

Tomorrow, we leave Dublin for points south.
