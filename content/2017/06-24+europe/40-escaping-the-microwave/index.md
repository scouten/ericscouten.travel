The _plan_ was to go slightly north from Pula to maybe Trieste on the Italian coast and lay low for a day or two before proceeding to the next airport. But instead a heat wave sunk in.

When we arrived in Trieste around noon, it was 35°C / 95°F, and it just wasn’t inspiring to get out and make photos in the bright light and intense heat.

So we kept heading north. We stopped briefly in Ljubljana for lunch and saw this amusing sign:

After lunch, we stopped in a small village to take a few pictures and stretch our legs.

I was shooting this picture ...

... when I heard somebody behind me yelling, "Hrvatska? Hrvatska?"

An older man was walking toward us. Quickly. He did not look at all friendly. At this moment, I remembered that "Hrvastka" is how you say Croatia in several of the local langauges. Our car had Croatian license plates.

I interrupted: "No. No. We're American."

He immediately warmed to us. We were given an impromptu tour of his village in the best English he could muster. As part of the tour, he took us through his neighbor's back yard where we shot pictures of perfectly-ripe grapes (and ate a few, too!).

(How often does being an American abroad _save_ you from potential trouble?)

After searching for places with a reasonable combination of temperature, scenery, and available lodging, we decided to head to Salzburg, Austria. That didn't leave time for more photos as we needed to pound down the ~~miles~~ kilometers and avoid the heat.

Tomorrow in Salzburg looks very promising.
