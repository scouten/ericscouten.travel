Today, we took the car east for a bit more exploring and a few photos.

<!-- more -->

We had hoped to spend some time at the zoo, but the weather here today was highly reminiscent of Seattle winter (11°C / 52°F and heavy rain), so we decided not to follow through on that plan.

Sadly, that also made it a not-fun day for making photos.

Looking forward to moving on to Ireland tomorrow.
