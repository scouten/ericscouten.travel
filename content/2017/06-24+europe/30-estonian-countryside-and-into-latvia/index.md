I left Tallinn this morning (Iâ€™ll be back ðŸ˜˜) and headed south through some rural roads and then into Latvia.

I had fully expected to have a similar reaction to Riga as I did to Tallinn, but I found a lot less charm here in Riga than I did farther north. (And also, the driving culture is the wildest I've yet encountered in Europe.)

Todayâ€™s photos are all from rural Estonia.
