Today we said farewell to Scotland and took a short afternoon flight to Dublin.

<!-- more -->

We'll be in Ireland for the next week or so and are eagerly awaiting having Tara join us the day after tomorrow.

Most of the good photos from today were from on board the flight. (OK, there _was_ a brief road trip between checking out of the hotel and arriving at the airport ...)
