Yesterday was a long day. Fortunately we had the option of taking a daytime flight from Boston, which I think (Ayla might disagree) made the time zone transition easier.

Today we ventured into the heart of London.

We slept in this morning and then found time for a quick tour of the city and to visit some friends. Not much for photos today. When we get up to Scotland (soon) there should be more time for such.
