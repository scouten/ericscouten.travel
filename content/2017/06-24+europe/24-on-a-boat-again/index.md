This morning we drove into Kristiansand in search of coffee (yes, we are _those_ American tourists who like fancy coffee drinks!) and a little shopping.

<!-- more -->

We went back to Mandal village for a very tasty lunch and then back to our resort.

We rented a boat to go exploring the islands around Tregde, but Ayla quickly decided the salt spray and waves were not for her. (I think she may have found the simple fiberglass boat we rented a bit ... sparse? ... compared to the livable boat our friends in Oslo had.) So ... back to the resort for Ayla (to spend time with Tara, who had already decided it was too cold to be out on the water) and then I went back out to shoot some photos from the water.

Given how lush the forest is on the mainland, I was surprised by how rocky the islands near Tregde were.

Tomorrow we are headed back to Oslo and then the next day we will make our farewell to beautiful Norway.
