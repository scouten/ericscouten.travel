This summer, I'll be taking advantage of one of my favorite of Adobe's employee benefits, the [sabbatical](https://benefits.adobe.com/us/time-off/sabbatical). As many of you know, I love to travel and I have always enjoyed my time in Europe, so what better thing to do than **more Europe?**

I'll try to write daily (or almost daily) about places, experiences, and, of course, photos. (If an Eric visits a place and there isn't a photo, did he really visit that place?)
