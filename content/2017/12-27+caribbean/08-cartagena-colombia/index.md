Happy New Years, everyone!

<!-- more -->

Yes, I know, it's a bit late. We celebrated the actual new year at sea, somewhere off the northern coast of Venezuela and pretty much bereft of any connection to the outside word.

It was nice to see land again this morning ...

This morning, I took a guided walk through a cute historic district, which started near the Castillo San Felipe de Barajas, a fortress built in 1536 and the site of several major battles over the centuries since.

These last two photos were taken as we sailed out of harbor from Cartagena and around the Fuerte de San Fernando de Bocachica. This is a much newer fort, having been constructed starting in 1753.
