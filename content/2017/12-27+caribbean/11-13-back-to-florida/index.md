After Costa Rica, it was time to head home. We sailed for two nights back to Fort Lauderdale. Since my flight back to Seattle departed late in the day, I had the opportunity to go out on a sight-seeing tour in the Everglades "on the way" to the airport.

Our first night out of Limón got a bit choppy. Which made the swimming pool a bit ... interesting. Thankfully nobody tried to actually swim in this.

I had asked friends for book recommendations before I departed. I saved this one for this long at-sea stretch. 30 pages in and I am booked ... I mean hooked. (Autocorrect attempting to make puns for me?)

Very much enjoying this new (to me) author. She had my attention from page 1. (**2023 Update**: I've now read everything Tana French has written. Can't wait for more!)

Props to Jim Thomsen or one of his colleagues at Eagle Harbor Books; this was on their staff recommendations shelf and definitely belonged there. 👍

So, the idea of this sight-seeing tour was to get in one of those air boats and find us some alligators. Turns out it _can_ get cold in Florida in January. Today, it was something like 7°C / 45°F.

So, as I said, we went out looking for alligators. When we got back to port from the tour, one of the shore staff asked if we'd seen any.

I said, "No, but we got close." And I showed her this picture:

Ah well, we had a good laugh. Turns out alligators can rest underwater for several hours at a time when it's cold like this. And, we suppose, that's what was happening.

The only alligator I saw was this one which, sadly, was in captivity:

This has been a good trip and well-timed break, but I'm glad to be home now.
