We sailed overnight to Curaçao, making this my second new island nation in as many days.

<!-- more -->

Given the political instability in Venezuela these days, I’m neither surprised nor disappointed that our itinerary did not include a stop there.

Of the two islands, I much preferred Curaçao: it was much more developed and refined. I wish that I had been able to rent a car from Willemstad, but alas, they were all sold out. I think I would have enjoyed exploring the island on my own.

Here are some photos from today's walkabout in the main city of Willemstad:
