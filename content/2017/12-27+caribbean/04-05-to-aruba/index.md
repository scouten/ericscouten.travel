After leaving the Bahamas, we sailed for most of two days to get to Aruba, an island nation just off the South American coast.

This was the view from my deck for most of these two days:

As we approached port in Oranjestad, a pilot boat was sent out to escort us in:

We had most of a day on shore and I took advantage of some tours that were offered:

People in Aruba love to set off elaborate fireworks displays, especially as the holidays approach. I love how people are so nonchalant about all the noise and commotion and eventually people just start driving through it. 

No matter how loud you have your speakers or headphones set, it is not even close to how loud it was in person:
