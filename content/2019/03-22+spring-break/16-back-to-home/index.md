Today we took a brief walk near our hotel and then began the long journey home.

We've enjoyed our time in Japan and look forward to returning some day!

## Postscript from Seattle

Finally back in Seattle, I had this funny exchange:

**Ferry toll booth attendant:** "How's your day going?"

**Me:** "Good. Yours?"

**Him:** "Sleepy. I had to wake up at four this morning."

**Me:** "I woke up in Tokyo this morning."

**Him** _(thinks a moment)_: "I think you have me beat."

**Me:** "I think I do."
