Like the last two days, there was a plan for today.

<!-- more -->

This plan had been in the works for years.

But unlike the last two days, this plan came to fruition.

20 years ago, I had my first opportunity to visit Europe. From that first visit, to Germany, for work, I fell in love. I have enjoyed returning many times in the years since.

This afternoon, when I landed in Malta, I completed something Iâ€™ve been actively pursuing for the last several years.

**Iâ€™ve set foot in all 28 member nations of the European Union.**

(With Brexit looming large, itâ€™s possible Iâ€™m one of the last people to attain that status while there are still 28. But I digress ...)

## 2023 Update: Plot Twist

Somebody whispered the name "Bulgaria" in my ear recently.

## ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡!

And ... ummm ... oops.

What I wrote above back in 2019 and moved over to this site in 2023 is all still true, except ... as it turns out, I've not been to all 28 EU countries. Nor all 27, as they are now.

Someday I shall visit Bulgaria and properly complete my ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡º exploration.

Meanwhile ... let's go back to Malta and what I wrote in 2019:

. . .

Honestly, I struggled a bit to find photographic themes in Cyprus.

In Malta, I have the opposite struggle: There is an abundance of photographic riches here.

Herewith, my favorites from todayâ€™s initial exploration:
