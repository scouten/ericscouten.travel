Any trip to Japan _must_ include a ride on the famously-fast Shinkansen trains.

We started today with a photo walk through [Heian Shrine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heian_Shrine), near where we were staying:

Ayla especially enjoyed the peach juice available from the vending machines here and there ...

Next up ... a very fast train!

Our trip on the famous Shinkansen trains took us to near where we would stay tonight. The track log from the time says we were going roughly 280 km/h / 175 mph during both of the videos that follow. (Yes, for the record, I like going fast.)

{{ es_vimeo(id = "es-3930-014", vmid = "834284049", caption = "Fujieda, Shizuoka, Japan") }}

{{ es_vimeo(id = "es-3930-015", vmid = "834284142", caption = "Our first view of Mount Fuji. · Fuji, Shizuoka, Japan") }}

The train took us as close as we could get to Mount Fuji. And then, being the adventurous driver that I am, I rented a car and drove us the hour or so from the train station to our hotel near Mount Fuji.

We arrived a bit too late for Mount Fuji pictures tonight. Hoping that I can wake up early tomorrow and make some magic happen.
