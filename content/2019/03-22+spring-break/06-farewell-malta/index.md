In case you haven't figured this out about me already, I like being a nomadic traveler.

<!-- more -->

Sometimes I skim a few places rather rapidly; sometimes I dive in deep on one place.

This trip is about exploring new places. Maybe some of them I will return to for a longer visit.

I started this morning with a walk around the neighborhood where I've been staying:

And then, since I had some time to spare, I drove a meandering route through the south of the island to the airport:

And now ... for something fun and new! It's a short flight (one hour) from Malta to Tunisia. So ... since I was "in the neighborhood," I made made this part of my nomadic plan.

We arrived near sunset, which made for some fun cloud- and sun-scapes on the way in.

For a kid from a small town in northern Minnesota, I've been tremendously fortunate in my travels. Maybe it's because I came from this remote, rural upbringing that I've made a point of getting out and seeing whatever I can.

I'm insatiably curious about this planet we live on and how we construct different styles of homes, villages, languages, cultures, mindsets, ways of living. I'll probably die on a plane going to some crazy remote place. And, if so, I'll die happy.

So, anyway, here I am for my first time ever visiting Africa. (Caveat: Most Tunisians don't really think of themselves as African. "Africa is south of the Sahara," as my driver told me.)

By the time I had cleared customs, it was dark out, so I went directly to my hotel. For the next couple of days, I will have plenty of time to explore.

I followed along on my map. Here's a street name we don't see back home!

I went up to the hotel's rooftop restaurant for dinner and found live music -- my favorite!

I was just informed that I was quite "courageous" for trying this dish, which the Tunisian Jews call something like kyla and the Tunisian Muslims call madfouna.

Whatever you call it, it is The Yum!
