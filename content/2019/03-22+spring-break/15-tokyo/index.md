This is our last full day in Japan. We mostly walked around the neighborhood in which we're staying.

The cherry blossoms were in bloom and there was some fun shopping to be done ...

I've driven a car in more than 40 countries and been a passenger in about another 20. Road signs, pavement markings, and all manner of traffic laws vary from country to country, but one thing is _almost_ perfectly consistent in my experience: a STOP sign is red and octagonal.

Except in Japan ...

(I've since learned that a few other countries use other shapes and sizes, but it is exceedingly rare.)
