Being the crazy photographer that I am, I awoke at 5am to capture sunrise at Mount Fuji. I was blessed with good weather that morning, and the resulting photo is the lead photo for today.

My daughter woke up a few hours later and we then drove back to return the car and resume the train trip into Tōkyō.

We transferred trains in Tōkyō's primary station.
