Being the crazy photographer that I am, I awoke at 5am to capture sunrise at Mount Fuji. I was blessed with good weather this morning, and the resulting photo is the lead photo for today.

My daughter woke up a few hours later and we then drove back to return the car and resume the train trip into Tōkyō.

We transferred trains in Tōkyō's primary station.

We're excited to check out the city in more detail tomorrow!
