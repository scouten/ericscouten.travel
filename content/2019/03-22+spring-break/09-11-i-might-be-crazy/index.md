And now, for something _completely_ different ...

I _almost_ flew around the world in 72 hours.

So, my travel route here may look a little crazy. It probably is.

But the thing is ... I wanted a special travel companion with me. So I few from Tunis to Seattle, stayed in Seattle for 22 hours, during which I picked up my daughter. And then the two of us flew to a place she's long wanted to visit: Japan.

First, let's bid farewell to Tunisia, as seen on departure from Tunis-Carthage Airport:

Not much from my other flights, as it was dark much of the time.

Ayla and I made a few videos of the passing countryside on the train from Ōsaka to Kyoto.

Looking forward to exploring Kyoto tomorrow!
