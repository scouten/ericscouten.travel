Ah, spring break is here.

<!-- more -->

If you know me at all, you know that I like to explore. So here I am, having just completed a 14-hour flight halfway around the world, beginning a two-week exploration that will have me in five new (to me) countries.

Tonight I am overnighting in the desert palace that is Dubai. Tomorrow morning I shall hop on another plane and start exploring the first of my new places.

Few pictures today, as this was a day full of plane travel without the benefit (or curse) of a window seat. Tomorrow should be good.

I may always find pilotsâ€™ ability to find a runway amazing, especially in the middle of the night:
