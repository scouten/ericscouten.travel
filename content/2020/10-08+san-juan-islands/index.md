I had the opportunity to take a long weekend away and visit two of the San Juan Islands.

<!-- more -->

Iâ€™m an insatiable traveler. Typically that plays out across the world, but here we are in 2020 and the safe and reasonable thing to do is to stay close to home. I am fortunate to live in a state with a wealth of beautiful travel opportunities.

As I thought about how to scratch my travel itch in these times, it occurred to me that we are blessed with many beautiful places to visit nearby. I took an inventory recently and counted 146 parks operated by our state parks system.

So, here begins [146 Parks](https://146parks.blog/), a project to visit all of Washington's state parks.

The first two are here:

* [1: Spencer Spit](https://146parks.blog/spencer-spit/)
* [2: Lime Kiln Point](https://146parks.blog/lime-kiln-point/)

While getting to and from those parks, there were a few other fun scenes, documented here:
