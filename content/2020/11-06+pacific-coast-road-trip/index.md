I know we don't (and shouldn't) get out much these days, but I needed to visit a family member in the Bay Area recently. Had a few days to get home, so that led to a coastal road trip and a [park visit](https://146parks.blog/leadbetter-point/) on the way back.

Mendocino, California, is one of my most favorite places in the world and I was thankful to spend my first night here.

That also meant I got to drive the northernmost stretch of California's Highway 1, which introduces itself thusly. (They aren't kidding, either. It's one of the most windy and fun roads out there, if you're into that sort of thing. I am.)

I spent the second night in Newport, Oregon, and set out at first light. That lead to this fun interplay of dawn's light and the coastal surf a little ways north in Depoe Bay:
