Tschüß, Hamburg! It's been a great week and a half working with the team here. Looking forward to a few days of travel and exploring on my own and then back to family and home!

...

Last night, our team went out to a small Greek restaurant in Hamburg tonight. The proprietor (originally from Greece, naturally) didn't speak English, but we eventually figured out that we could communicate in Spanish. (!)

"Why did he learn to speak Spanish?," we asked.

"¡Para las chicas!"

Por supuesto. Debería haber sabido.

...

This evening, I went for a long walk around Amsterdam. I stoped for a "don't walk" light. A guy walked up and waited next to me.

**Him:** "Got any paper?"

**Me:** "Huh?"

**Him:** "Got any paper ... you know ... to roll a joint?"

**Me**: _(laughing)_ "No."

**Him:** "I guess not. You didn't look like a smoker."

There was a pause.

The light was still red, but there was no traffic, so I started to cross the street.

**Him:** "Stop! Stop! It's red!"

I stopped. There was another pause.

**Him:** "You here for the convention?"

**Me:** "No."

There was another pause.

**Him:** "If you need anything ... some cocaine, whatever ..."

I shook my head "no" and waved him off.

He crossed the street.

The light was still red.
