Tschüß, Hamburg! It's been a great week and a half working with the team here. Looking forward to a few days of travel and exploring on my own and then back to family and home!

Last night, our team went out to a small Greek restaurant in Hamburg tonight. The proprietor (originally from Greece, naturally) didn't speak English, but we eventually figured out that we could communicate in Spanish. (!)

"Why did he learn to speak Spanish?," we asked.

"¡Para las chicas!"

Por supuesto. Debería haber sabido.
