I'm headed to Hamburg, Germany, for a week of meetings at our offices there, and then having some fun while I'm in the neighborhood.

<!-- more -->

Had the opportunity to look down on some great clouds this morning. These are from the the North Sea just east of England and then on approach to Amsterdam.
