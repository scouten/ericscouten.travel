I added Luxembourg to my [list of countries visited](/countries/) and found it absolutely charming.

<!-- more -->

I'll add one more tomorrow morning.

I wish I had given myself a bit more time for the drive through Switzerland. Darkness hit about the time I drove around Zürich.

When I was planning today's route last night, Google gave me this warning:

![Warning: This route crosses through multiple countries.](google-maps-warning.png)

My dear Google, that's the flipping point! Haven't you learned that about me yet?

(The more appropriate warning might have been, "That's a long distance to drive in one day.")
