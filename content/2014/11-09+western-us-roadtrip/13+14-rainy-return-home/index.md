Not so many photos from this part of the trip because it was mostly freeway miles and mostly rainy, but here goes a little bit ...

<!-- more -->

Mile 3416: This is the price of admission to Mendocino. Well worth it IMHO.

Mile 3948: I’m back in Washington state. Being given a proper winter welcome!

Mile 4135: Home. Nothing like the hug of a child who's been missing Daddy!
