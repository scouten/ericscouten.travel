Good news: Northern California is getting some much needed rain today. 

Bad news: I wound up with two hours of dark, wet driving on windy roads at the end of the day.

I did get to make a few black and white photos with the new infrared camera today before I realized I had to focus on making time.

* This morning: Barren desert in the Central Valley.
* Tonight: Redwoods and rain.

Tomorrow I get to lay low in Mendocino, then it's onward to home over the next two days after that.

This is probably about my 10th visit to Mendocino. I think I discovered it when I first interviewed at Adobe (unsuccessfully) circa 1991.
