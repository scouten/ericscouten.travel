Today, I drove a slice through northeastern California and made a few fun infrared photos.

Mile 621: how to market yourself in a small town. “Starbucks is 70 miles away. Our coffee will get you there.” (Hey, it got me to stop!)

Mile 777: Settled in to Reno and looking forward to dinner with some friends who coincidentally in town today. It was a nice leisurely drive today. Lots of stopping and shooting. Some fun mountain driving. Almost no freeway miles, which was just fine by me.
