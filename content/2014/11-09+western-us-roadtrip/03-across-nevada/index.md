A long day on the road today, but I do love a long day driving through the desert ...

Mile 889: Alright friends, staying off the slab -- and, on the lonely roads -- today!

Not quite like the Kingston in Washington!

Mile 1089: Ooh, that’s lonely. Not going down that road.

{{ es_cdn_image(id = "es-2719-007", cdn_version = "v1", cdn_key = "img/v1/2014/11/es-2719-007", caption = "Tonopah, Nevada") }}

Mile 1334: Long, quiet day. Possibly, quite possibly, 500+ miles of desert driving in one day is a few too many.

Observation: Nevada drivers are kinda crazy. And I don't mean just in Vegas, where there's an abnormally high number of skid marks on the freeways. Saw some really ill-advised passing out in lonelyville.
