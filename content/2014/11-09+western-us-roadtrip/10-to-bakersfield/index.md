After a few days with friends in Arizona, it's now time to head back.

<!-- more -->

Mile 2495: We ran out of street names.

{{ es_cdn_image(id = "es-2728-006", cdn_version = "v1", cdn_key = "img/v1/2014/11/es-2728-006", caption = "Quartzsite, Arizona") }}

Mile 2556: I like lonely desert drives. Score!

{{ es_cdn_image(id = "es-2728-009", cdn_version = "v1", cdn_key = "img/v1/2014/11/es-2728-009", caption = "west of Vidal, California") }}

Mile 2568: So … Is this graffiti or not? Looks like just rearranging rocks that were already there.

{{ es_cdn_image(id = "es-2728-011", cdn_version = "v1", cdn_key = "img/v1/2014/11/es-2728-011", caption = "west of Vidal, California") }}

{{ es_cdn_image(id = "es-2728-015", cdn_version = "v1", cdn_key = "img/v1/2014/11/es-2728-015", caption = "west of Vidal, California") }}

Mile 2683: Desert sunset.

{{ es_cdn_image(id = "es-2728-030", cdn_version = "v1", cdn_key = "img/v1/2014/11/es-2728-030", caption = "northwest of Landers, California") }}

Mile 2900: Fun desert driving today and settled in for the night.

Didn't really intend to take the swing _through_ Los Angeles, but I missed the turn to go north out of Victorville. Didn't catch it until the damage was done. Fortunately, I was just late enough that traffic was not bad at all.
