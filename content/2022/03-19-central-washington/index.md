The idea, [again](../01-14-eastern-washington/) was to visit some more parks for the [146 Parks](https://146parks.blog) project. Weather intervened; that plan didn't happen, but a good trip was had nonetheless.

I started the day at a cute little coffee shop called [The Early Bird](https://earlybirdeatery.com) in downtown Ellensburg.

From Ellensburg, I headed northeast toward Sun Lakes-Dry Falls and Steamboat Rock State Parks.

A fair amount of Sun Lakes-Dry Falls State Park was seasonally closed, so I decided to save this for another time.

I started a more serious hike in Steamboat Rock State Park a couple hours later, but serious rains set in before I could accomplish my hiking goal for the day. I'll share one highlight photo from the park and save this again for another day.

The weather opened up quite a bit, so I did manage to get in a previously-unplanned visit to [Bridgeport State Park](https://146parks.blog/bridgeport/).

And then I wrapped up the day at the beautiful mountaintop resort at [Sun Mountain Lodge](https://www.sunmountainlodge.com).

On my way home the next day, I got in a good hike at [Peshastin Pinnacles State Park](https://146parks.blog/peshastin-pinnacles/).
