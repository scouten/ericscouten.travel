The plan was to head east and visit a bunch of new parks for the [146 Parks](https://146parks.blog) project. That only sort of happened, but a good time was had nonetheless.

<!-- more -->

The good news is that I _did_ visit the one park that I had heard was _best_ visited in winter, [Mount Spokane](https://146parks.blog/mount-spokane), which is basically a publicly-operated ski resort northeast of the city of Spokane.

The even better news is that I got some very nice winter / fog photos that I can share here along the way.

I did set foot in a couple of other parks, but I've filed those away under "better visited in warmer weather." I've included a few photos as teasers of those parks for now, but they won't appear on the parks blog until I revisit them and can do a proper hike and visit.
