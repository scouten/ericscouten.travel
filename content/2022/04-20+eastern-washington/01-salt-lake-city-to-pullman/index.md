Here's why: My partner's team was being honored in Pullman tonight. So I flew back from Salt Lake City to Spokane and landed a few hours before her flight landed in Pullman. Since I had some time, I meandered through northern Idaho on the way.

Not much for photos as I was on a bit of a timeline, but here's one from near Saint Maries:
