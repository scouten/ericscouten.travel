We took this evening to satisfy a curiousity about Stansbury Island, which is not _entirely_ an island any more due to lower lake levels.

<!-- more -->

What it _is_ is a very remote place towards the west side of Great Salt Lake. Some parts of the island are public (accessible via a lonely gravel road), but much of the island is private property, used (mostly?) for mining.

We enjoyed what we could see from the road:
