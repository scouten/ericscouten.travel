On our last full day of the trip, we took off a bit early to enjoy the sun and scenery.

Our explorations led us on an unsuccessful attempt to find Promontory Point, the location at which the first transcontinental railroad was completed. There were a few dead ends that were not marked as such on the map. Ah well.

We then drove to [Antelope Island State Park](https://stateparks.utah.gov/parks/antelope-island/), which I had [visited a couple of months earlier](/2022/04-15+utah/03-saltair-and-antelope-island/).
