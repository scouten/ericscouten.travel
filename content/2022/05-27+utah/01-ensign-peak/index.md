I'm in Utah for a few days for a family visit. I had a few hours to myself upon arrival and decided to check out the [Ensign Peak Trail](https://www.visitsaltlake.com/listing/ensign-peak/55163/), which offered some nice views from above the city.

I got in just before some rains set in, which meant there were some fun sky-drama photos.

This is a short hike (~1.5km / 1 mile), but there's some good elevation gain along the way. It was a good workout after the hours of sitting in cars and planes.

From the top of the hill, you can see a panoramic view of the city.
