As I am so often inclined to do, I took the long way from Port Jefferson into the city.

<!-- more -->

And by the long way, I mean the very long way ... to the very eastern tip of the north fork of Long Island.

Turns out I had covered some of this same ground [20 years earlier](/2002/02-23-long-island/), ironically also when adding a weekend to an Adobe business trip.

I was tempted to ride another ferry, but it did not fit my schedule for this day.

I did hike out from the end of the road to the very tip of the point:

When I circled back through Greenport, I noticed a familiar name. Turns out I had taken a picture of this same hardware store [20 years ago](/2002/02-23-long-island/). I kind of like the older sign better.

Not much for pictures the remainder of the day, but I did enjoy this water tower that I saw from my hotel room.
