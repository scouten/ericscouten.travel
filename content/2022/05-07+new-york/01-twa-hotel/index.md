I arrived this evening a bit early for some meetings at Adobe's New York offices. As is often the case with travel, there were some misadventures and delays, but it all worked out OK. The highlight of this evening was a stay at the [TWA Hotel](https://www.twahotel.com).

But first, for something completely different ... here was the view while I was waiting for the ferry in Kingston, near my home.

No mid-air photos as I was in an aisle seat this time. But I made up for it with on-the-ground photos at the TWA, which makes a deep homage to the 1960s era in which the original terminal was built.

I was fortunate to arrive in time to enjoy a cocktail in a 1958 Lockheed Constellation "Connie" airplane, which had been retrofitted into a cocktail lounge:

I'll admit to feeling rather underdressed for the occasion!

My room was a delightful combination of retro and modern:

(A few late-breaking photos from the morning after ...)

I love that they even carried the TWA branding through to the fire extinguishers!
