I had all day today to explore. I decided to head up the Connecticut coast for a while and then take a [ferry from Bridgeport to the north shore of Long Island](https://www.88844ferry.com).

I found a [hotel on the waterfront in Port Jefferson](https://www.danfords.com), right near the ferry terminal, and spent the night there.
