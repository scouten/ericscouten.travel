Today, Lisa and I took the ferry across to Orcas Island and explored for the day.

<!-- more -->

I got to add one new park to my parks blog. (See separately: [Obstruction Pass State Park](https://146parks.blog/obstruction-pass/) on [146 Parks](https://146parks.blog).)

This was a rare sunny winter day in the islands, so we got some great views from the ferry, which stopped at Shaw Island on its way from Lopez to Orcas.

This was a day trip, so we didn't stay on the island, but I enjoyed the look of the Outlook Inn.

I scoped out what appears to be a great launch point for a future kayak trip to [Sucia Island](https://www.parks.wa.gov/594/Sucia-Island) for the parks project.

We drove through what we could of [Moran State Park](https://www.parks.wa.gov/547/Moran), but a lot of the park was seasonally closed, so we'll save that for another time.

We stopped for a drink in Eastsound before heading back for the 6:45 ferry. Here was our sunset view.
