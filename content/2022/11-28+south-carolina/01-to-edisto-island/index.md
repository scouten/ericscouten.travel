Lisa had a bit of a head start on me, having spent Thanksgiving visiting her friends in Edisto Island. Today I flew from Seattle to Charleston and then drove to meet them.

I had a window seat and got the opportunity to look down on snowy mountainscapes for the first part of the journey. A few of these made it to Facebook while I was still in-flight.

Lisa and her friend Nicky had been spending the day at [Botany Bay Heritage Preserve](https://www2.dnr.sc.gov/ManagedLands/ManagedLand/ManagedLand/57). My flight landed a bit too late for me to enjoy it today, but I'm excited to check it out later this week. Here's a preview from her day there:

We met just after sunset and what a treat it was!
