We awoke this morning to news that our flight home to Seattle had been canceled. This gave us the opportunity to sleep in a bit and then go visit Botany Bay, near Edisto Beach.

I'd long heard of this location, famous for its weather-worn trees standing in the sand and water. I've seen some ethereal photos taken in this site in foggy weather, but today we had bright sunlight.

I hope to return some day in moodier weather.
