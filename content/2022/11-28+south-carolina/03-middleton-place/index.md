Today we explored [Middleton Place](https://www.middletonplace.org), a centuries-old plantation that has survived from the 18th century and been preserved as a tourist attraction and historic landmark.

To be fair, the definition of "survived" must acknowledge damage done during the Civil War and the [1886 earthquake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1886_Charleston_earthquake). Significant parts of the plantation were reduced to rubble in those events:

This is what remains of the original residential complex, the south "flanker" once used as guest quarters and now a museum. We enjoyed the tour inside this building which featured artwork and furniture from the Middleton family owned. In compliance with museum rules, we did not take photos while inside the building.

We then spent some more time exploring the grounds.
