We had heard a strong recommendation to check out [Hunting Island State Park](https://southcarolinaparks.com/hunting-island), so "on our way" from our friends' house on Edisto Island to Charleston, we checked it out.

Now, driving along the coast in South Carolina is an exercise in avoiding large marshy river deltas, so it took us a fair while to get there, as you'll see in the <a href="#map">map below</a>.

We started with a stroll on the beach (no photos) and then walked out on the Marsh Boardwalk to investigate one of the hammock islands.

A fisherman we met there encouraged us to go a few miles down the arod to the Nature Center Scenic Trail. We did, and oh, what a good suggestion that was!

It was near dusk when we got there and -- as with the night before -- we were treated to beautiful sunset scenes.

Welcome to Boneyard Beach, where shifting sands have transformed a once-forested marsh into a sandy beach with the occasional remnants of now-lifeless trees.

We'll be in Charleston the next few days. Looking forward to exploring this historic city!
