I flew down to Salt Lake City today. I'll work for a couple of days from there and then my daughter and I will embark on a road trip together for a few days.

By far, the highlight of this flight was this spectacular view of Mount Rainier.

Later, on approach to Salt Lake, we were treated to some nice views of rural Utah at sunset:
