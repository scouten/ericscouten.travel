So, it turns out it's a long way from Salt Lake City to Denver. We drove this over two days with a brief stop in Wyoming. Mostly it gave us a chance to catch up and talk and do some shopping. There were lots of wide-open spaces and we didn't take much time to stop for photos.

Loved this mural on a school near where we're staying in Denver:
