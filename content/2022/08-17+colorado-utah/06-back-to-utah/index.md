We made most of our way back to Utah today, but this time via the "southern" route (i.e. I-70 as far as was reasonable).

I regret that it wasn't possible to make photographs while driving Glenwood Canyon in Colorado. That part will live on only in my memory.

Once we turned off the freeway and onto smaller roads, I could make some photos again. Most of these are in the northwest corner of Colorado:

We spent the night in Vernal, Utah, a few hours east of Salt Lake City, and the supposed gateway to dinosaur land.
