My partner and I took an impromptu trip to Portland and Astoria this weekend. We discovered two great hotels and added three new parks to the [146 Parks](https://146parks.blog) project.

## [Hotel Grand Stark, Portland](https://www.palisociety.com/hotels/hotel-grand-stark)

Hotel Grand Stark is a cute boutique hotel in Portland's Eastside neighborhood. We found a fun variety of restaurants nearby and enjoyed its quirky décor.

The next morning we left for Astoria by way of [Paradise Point](https://146parks.blog/paradise-point) State Park.

## Astoria River Views

We arrived in Astoria in time to check out the [Columbia River Maritime Museum](https://www.crmm.org), which was great fun. (We'll leave the pictures to them!)

And then were treated to some great sunset views on the river.

## [Bowline Hotel, Astoria](https://bowlinehotel.com)

I've long been a fan of the [Cannery Pier Hotel](https://www.cannerypierhotel.com) when I go to Astoria, but they are currently closed for renovations. The Bowline turned out to be a very fun and cute alternative. Situated on the waterfront right in the heart of downtown Astoria, it was an easy walk from there to a wide variety of restaurants and its own lobby bar, The Knot, offered some creative cocktails.

On our way out of town, we took a friend's recommendation and had breakfast at the [Street 14 Café](http://www.street14cafe.com).

We visited two new parks on Sunday, [Fort Columbia](https://146parks.blog/fort-columbia) and [Loomis Lake](https://146parks.blog/loomis-lake). OK, actually we visited three new parks, but we realized that [Cape Disappointment](https://www.parks.wa.gov/486/Cape-Disappointment) was larger than we had time for this weekend.

One picture for now, and we'll be back!
