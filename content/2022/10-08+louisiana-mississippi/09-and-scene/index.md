Today it was time to head home. We left our AirBNB in the Garden District in the morning and had several hours before our flight back to Seattle. Being the road geek that I am, I wanted to drive some of the longest bridges in the country.

We started with the Lake Pontchartrain Causeway, which runs 24 miles more or less due north from the city. Lisa captured this image from mid-span:

Once across, we decided to have some lunch and check out a state park on the north side of the lake before turning back to the airport.

I got a bonus long-bridge tour on the way back, in that the southern end of I-55 (the [Manchac Swamp Bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchac_Swamp_Bridge)) dumps into I-10 near the airport to form one of the longest continuous bridgeways in the US. (Sadly, we have no pictures from that run.)
