After a few days meeting with my team in our Bay Area offices, I flew to New Orleans to meet my partner who would be attending a conference here for a few days.

I don't usually take window seats, but when I do, I get some amazing views:

So, of _course_ once we got settled in, we checked out the French Quarter. First things first ... we had to find some seafood for dinner. Look up in the second photo below: I love the ceiling fans driven by pulleys from a single motor (on the right of this frame).

Dinner behind us, we took a walk along Bourbon Street. It being a Saturday night, it was every bit the party scene you might imagine!
