Friends told us that we should walk down a certain street in the Garden District at night and there would be a show to behold. Mind you, New Orleans in general does not disappoint when it comes to Halloween decor, but our friends were right. This house stood out.

Turns out this was [Ghost Manor](https://ghostmanor.org), which is an intense labor of love put forward for whoever happens to stroll by on an October evening. On our night by here, it was very popular.

And a show unlike any other I've seen.

If you're going to cover Pink Floyd with skeletons, you get points for choosing their song titled _In the Flesh._
