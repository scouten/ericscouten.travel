Our agenda for this day was perhaps a bit too ambitious. We departed New Orleans mid-morning, explored the Mississippi Delta region a bit, and then met some friends of mine from Washington who now live in the Gulf Coast of Mississippi State. The plan worked ... but just barely.

We drove to the very end of the Mississippi Delta (or at least as far as we could before the road was flooded out!).

I had assumed that there was a river crossing east of New Orleans that we could use. It was only when I asked my phone for directions for my friends' house in Mississippi that I discovered that I was wrong and we'd best get moving quickly. 

So ... very few pictures from that part of the trip.

I did have to take a moment to capture this road sign with (in my humble opinion) unnecessary precision:

We arrived near sunset, which led to a few nice pictures of their home. They've done a lot of nice work in remodeling since moving there a few years ago.

Kathy and Gary took us out to dinner in a nearby town by way of the "Scenic Drive," which let us look in on a few coastal mansions.

And here is the last bit of sunset from the deck of our dinner venue:

A great time was had by all and I'm thankful for the chance to have reconnected.
