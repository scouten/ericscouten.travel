We were in town because was Lisa was attending the [WEFTEC conference](https://www.weftec.org). The conference was not messing around. They rented out several massive exhibition halls at New Orleans' largest convention center and had this rather impressive branding installed just outside the convention center.

I later learned (through a rather spectacular navigation/trip planning error) that this bridge is the southernmost crossing of the Mississippi. We recovered from the navigation error, but it would have been oh-so-much better had there been a crossing an hour or two south of there like I had imagined.
