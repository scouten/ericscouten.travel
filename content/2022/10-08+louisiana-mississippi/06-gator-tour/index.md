Louisiana is famous for its swamps and bayous. And the gators that live within them. We took a sightseeing tour today with [Cajun Encounters](https://www.cajunencounters.com) to the Honey Island Swamp near Slidell. And we saw gators!

The swamp itself is an etheral landscape, unlike anything we're used to in the Pacific Northwest.

We later would learn that these were just the kids – a mere four or five feet long. The big guys would come later ...

We were thankful to be in a self-contained boat; every tree, every bit of land contains a potential hazard:

After the swamp, our captain took us around the bend in the Old Pearl River (at an exhilarating 30mph on the water!) to a lagoon where the big gators live. These were thought to be 10-15 feet long and there were _many_ of them. Here are a few close-ups!
