With the conference nearly over, we decided to take an evening walking tour of the French Quarter and to learn about the city's ghostly history.

This being New Orleans, we were walking with drinks in our hands (yes, that's legal there, unlike most of the US) and we were asked not to make audio or video recordings during the tour. So the ghost stories didn't really come home with us. My advice: Go see the tour on your own!

Haunted or not, the tour served as an excuse to admire the well-preserved history of the city. Here are a few of our favorites:
