On our last full day of the trip, we decided to divide and conquer. I road-tripped again (shocker!) and Lisa explored the city a bit. My travels today took me to another coastal area, Grand Isle.

First, meet my friend "Henry Alex," who seemed to be out of place (i.e. on land).

Closer to the coast, the road was clinging to a fairly narrow strip of land.

As in much of the Gulf Coast, homes in Grand Isle are built well above ground level in an effort to survive the storm surges that accompany hurricanes.

Part of my reason for wanting to visit Grand Isle was to satisfy a curiosity about the Gateway to the Gulf Expressway, one of the longest bridges in the world at more than 13km / 8 miles long.

Here is the south end of the bridge:

I drove back along the old Highway 1. The new bridge is on the horizon, maybe half a mile from where I took this photo:

And, finally, on the way back, here, again, is my friend Henry Alex, as seen from the other side of the river.
