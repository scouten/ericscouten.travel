On our last full day of the trip, we decided to divide and conquer. I road-tripped again (shocker!) and Lisa explored the city a bit. My travels today took me to another coastal area, Grand Isle.

<!-- more -->

First, meet my friend "Henry Alex," who seemed to be out of place (i.e. on land).

Closer to the coast, the road was clinging to a fairly narrow strip of land.

{{ es_cdn_image(id = "es-4426-010", cdn_version = "v1", cdn_key = "img/v1/2022/10/es-4426-010", caption = "south of Golden Meadow, Louisiana") }}
{{ es_cdn_image(id = "es-4426-032", cdn_version = "v1", cdn_key = "img/v1/2022/10/es-4426-032", caption = "south of Golden Meadow, Louisiana") }}
{{ es_cdn_image(id = "es-4426-037", cdn_version = "v1", cdn_key = "img/v1/2022/10/es-4426-037", caption = "Leeville, Louisiana") }}

As in much of the Gulf Coast, homes in Grand Isle are built well above ground level in an effort to survive the storm surges that accompany hurricanes.

{{ es_cdn_image(id = "es-4426-045", cdn_version = "v1", cdn_key = "img/v1/2022/10/es-4426-045", title = "Hurricane Hole", caption = "Grand Isle, Louisiana") }}

Part of my reason for wanting to visit Grand Isle was to satisfy a curiosity about the Gateway to the Gulf Expressway, one of the longest bridges in the world at more than 13km / 8 miles long.

Here is the south end of the bridge:

I drove back along the old Highway 1. The new bridge is on the horizon, maybe half a mile from where I took this photo:

And, finally, on the way back, here, again, is my friend Henry Alex, as seen from the other side of the river.

{{ es_cdn_image(id = "es-4426-096", cdn_version = "v1", cdn_key = "img/v1/2022/10/es-4426-096", caption = "west of Larose, Louisiana") }}
