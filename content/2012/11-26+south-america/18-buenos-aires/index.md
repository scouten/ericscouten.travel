Looking across the river this morning, we could see on the horizon the skyscrapers of Buenos Aires. Such a difference from the sleepy historic town that is Colonia. We'll be crossing over in a few hours ...

This turned out to be no ordinary ferry. The Rio Plata at this point is _very_ wide, but the crossing did not take long. My GPS showed our speed at 70 km/h / 45mph for most of the route. With hundreds of passengers and their cars. I am impressed.

We made a few photos walking around the La Boca neighborhood where we are staying.

I regret that we have only a day here. We heard a lot about Buenos Aires and I think we would have enjoyed more time there had it been feasible. Some other trip, I hope.
