Wow isn't enough for this place. The name Iguazú (or, in Portuguese, Iguaçu) is adapted from an indigenous name meaning "big water." That still isn't enough to describe it. The important thing to understand when looking at each of the photos I'm showing here is that they each represent a small portion of the falls.

Today, we crossed back into Brazil to capture the falls from a different perspective.

No idea who this creature was, but I thought it was adorable.

This video by Tara is a bit jittery but it gives you an idea of the enormity of the falls.

Later, back in Argentina, I went for another walk to the Argentine falls and happened upon the finish line for one stage in the Norwegian edition of _Amazing Race_. Didn't get to see any of the teams arrive, though. Apparently two teams had already arrived by then.
