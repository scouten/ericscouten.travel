Today I have arrived in Salvador, Brazil, where I will spend the next three days. I am absolutely thrilled with this last-minute historic hotel find in Salvador.

This leg of the trip was a last-minute improvisation. Salvador is Brazil's third largest city, and a good refuge from the crazy-high prices of Rio at this time of year.

I received a lot of advice about rush hour traffic being bad (it wasn't) and wound up getting through security almost two hours ahead of departure time. (It's probably worth noting that I flew out of the smaller [Santos Dumont Airport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santos_Dumont_Airport) instead of Rio's international airport.) I would have slept in a bit more if I had known _that_ would happen!

Domestic terminal security moves pretty quickly here. Small wonder: Nobody has to take their shoes or belts off. Also: No need to remove laptops from bags. After scanning my bag, the X-ray tech smiled at me and said "tomar fotos?"

After a two-hour flight and a 40-minute cab ride, I have landed at the amazing Pestana Convento do Carmo Hotel Histórico, which is a 1500s-era convent lovingly renovated into a hotel. (**2022 Update:** Sadly, this hotel now appears to have closed permanently. It was such a beautiful site; I hope they can reopen it someday.)

Most of the images that follow are from the hotel itself or from some short walks around the cobblestone streets of the [Pelourinho neighborhood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historic_Center_of_Salvador) in which it is located.

Being in this location, on the edge of Salvador’s historic Pelourinho district, was both a blessing and a curse. A blessing because there was a lot of interesting subject matter to shoot within easy walking district. A curse because everyone warned me that I needed to be hyper-vigilant due to the high rate of street crime in that area. So I took relatively short walks in daylight in areas I came to know and feel safer in. Being a very fair-skinned person with an expensive camera around my neck definitely made me feel highly visible.
