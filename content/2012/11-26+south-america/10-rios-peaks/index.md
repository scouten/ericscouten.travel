No visit to Rio is complete without a visit to the iconic statue; wouldn’t you agree?

Since the famous statue is atop one of Rio's many peaks, it offers some spectacular views of the city and ocean:

On the tram back down, we were treated to some local samba music:

We later visited Sugarloaf Peak (known locally as _Morro de Urca_), which allowed us to enjoy more views of the city and its beaches.

Tomorrow we leave Rio to see Iguaçu Falls.
