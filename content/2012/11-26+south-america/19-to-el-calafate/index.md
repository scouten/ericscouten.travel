This morning I strolled around La Recoleta Cemetery, near where we are staying. Our time in Buenos Aires was much too short, but such are the choices made in an ambitious trip such as this.

As I write this, Tara is flying home (yay for rest of family; boo for me!) and I have flown four hours farther south.

My flight south marked a welcome respite from the heat and humidity of the previous two weeks (and for this cold-blooded northwoods boy, that was a very welcome change indeed!). El Calafate is a clean, quiet town in far southern Patagonia with something like 22,000 people -- and almost no development to speak of beyond the city limits.

Yes, I'm _that_ far south!

I'll explore more tomorrow, but here's a quick sense of the view from my hotel. Sunset tonight is almost 10pm.
