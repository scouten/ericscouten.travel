Not much for photos today; it was mostly a day of relaxing and enjoying a much-needed shower after last night's water system misadventure. I started my journey back north today. I'll stay tonight in San Carlos de Bariloche, on the eastern edge of the Andes.

Before I left El Calafate, I captured one last view of Lago Argentino from my hotel:

After a bit of a wild-West rodeo flight, I arrived here in San Carlos de Bariloche. Tomorrow, I'll head into and over these mountains and enter Chile for the first time.
