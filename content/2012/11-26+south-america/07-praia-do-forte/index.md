Today, I took a bus tour up to [Praia do Forte](https://wikitravel.org/en/Praia_do_Forte), a tourist beach village about 80 km / 50 miles east of Salvador.

It’s definitely a touristy resort, but still offered some interesting sights and a welcome contrast to the urban center of Salvador. It being a very hot and sunny day when we arrived, I experimented a lot with the infrared camera.

On the way back, I got one quick photo of the lighthouse at the entrance to Salvador's harbor right at sunset.
