Today I took a tour west from El Calafate to Parque Nacional Los Glaciares, home to the Perito Moreno glacier.

<!-- more -->

The park is roughly an hour drive from El Calafate over some very quiet roads:

I had the opportunity to view the glacier up close (by boat) and then from above (from some trails and overlooks in the park). I can only hope to have captured a bit of the scale of this river of ice.

As an extra bonus travel adventure, the municipal water system in El Calafate failed while I was away. No hot shower for me, or anyone else.

It will be back tonight "we hope," says the manager at the hotel.
