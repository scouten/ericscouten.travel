This morning I bid farewell to the convent/hotel where I was staying. Such a lovely hotel. Amazingly well renovated.

This evening, I'm back in Rio.

A few quick observations before I head off for sleep:

* In the airport, they have closed-circuit TV showing the baggage guys loading your stuff onto the carousel. I like.
* I'm on the fourth floor of the hotel and I'm pretty sure the helicopter that just flew by over the beach was below my level. 😳
* I may finally be getting the hang of this: 9pm dinner on the waterfront, caipirinha #2, and yummy Arab food.
