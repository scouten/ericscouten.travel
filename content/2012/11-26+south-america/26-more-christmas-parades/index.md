This morning I went for one more walk around downtown Cuenca. There were many more Christmas / school-end parades. Such a festive time!

I'm back in Quito tonight, having taken a late-afternoon flight back north. My hotel in Quito asked a mere US$30 to extend my checkout time from noon to 9pm tomorrow. That, my friends, is what I call a No-Brainer. My flight from Quito to Atlanta leaves the next "morning" at 12:30am, thus the unusual checkout time request.

This has been a wonderful trip, but I am very ready to be home.
