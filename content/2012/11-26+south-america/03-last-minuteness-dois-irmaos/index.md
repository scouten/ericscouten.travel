So it turns out that just showing up in Brazil without a rock solid-plan for what you are going to do and where you're going to stay is ... not great.

Some plans I had made for these first few days in Brazil fell through right before I started this trip. It took a few hours of online wrangling this afternoon (and more $$$ than I would have liked), but I have now filled in the gaps in my schedule here.

The Brazilian tourist industry is running at about 99% capacity, even though it is really only late spring here. I would have expected it to peak in January, but it's only late November and almost all places are sold out. What remains is at the fringes of the price curve: either really sketchy or more expensive than you might prefer. I'm traveling with a lot of camera gear so I don't feel comfortable with "sketchy." (Maybe I should be taking photos of the upscale lodging instead. üòâ)

I've been staying in the [Santa Teresa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Teresa,_Rio_de_Janeiro) neighborhood so far (will be elsewhere in Rio tomorrow) and have found great places to eat and stay here.

I did get to spend an hour or so around lunch time walking along the famous Ipanema Beach. What follows are some photos including the¬†Dois Irm√£os (Two Brothers) mountains that form the western end of the beach.

I'll stay tomorrow night in a new part of Rio, then I'm headed north to Salvador (historic community, wildlife viewing, beaches) for three nights, and then back to Rio the night before Tara arrives.
