A delightful breakfast here at Hotel Santa Teresa and then it's off to a new location in Rio. This was a great place to crash and rest up from the rigors of travel. On to the next place!

Here are a few scenes from the hotel and surrounding area:

This was the view from my room the first two nights in Rio. Also my first (public) experiment with infrared photography.

Tonight I'm staying at another hotel near Copacabana Beach. If I'm to be honest, Rio is a bit much for me. I'm headed to Salvador tomorrow for a few days. I'm looking forward to being out of the big city.
