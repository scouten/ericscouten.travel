Before embarking on the long journey home, I took one last tour to see some highlights of Quito.

<!-- more -->

It being the Saturday before Christmas, the city was completely overrun with last-minute shoppers, as you might imagine. I think having a car would be a curse. It was difficult enough to navigate the city on foot.

Unlike typical US cities, the "market" is largely conducted outside with street vendors in booths and impromptu tents along the sidewalks. I was warned against walking alone with expensive camera equipment especially today, so most of today's photos and videos of the pedestrian chaos are from my iPhone.

Just as in Cuenca, there were many Christmas / end-of-school parades ...

I met this woman on the streets of Quito this morning. She was selling handmade scarves. I didn’t notice her little assistant sticking his hand out from under a scarf until I was editing photos later!

As I write this, this journey is well and truly over. I am home and very happy to be here.

Thank you for following along.
