Yesterday I flew down to the mountain city of Cuenca. Today I took a guided tour of the city. Lots of fun scenes to share!

Before departing Quito, I walked around the city a bit. Unlike in the US, the school year in Ecuador aligns with the calendar year, so there were lots of end-of-school ceremonies and parades with very well-dressed little ones.

After a short flight to Cuenca, I walked around a bit ...

My hotel placed a bit of Christmas cheer on my door!

Earlier today, I took a long guided driving/walking tour of the city. Lots of historic buildings to view:

Later we toured a hat factory, where the would-be hats were soaking in some kind of solution:

I love the disembodied legs that make the Ecuadorian sign for pedestrian crossing:
