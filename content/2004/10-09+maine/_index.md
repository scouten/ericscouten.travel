I leave Saturday night (9 October) for a week-long adventure to the Maine coast. Several co-workers and I are taking part in a fall foliage photography workshop led by [John Paul Caponigro](https://www.johnpaulcaponigro.com/blog/home/). I've tacked on a couple of days before and after the workshop to explore the coast a bit more on my own.
