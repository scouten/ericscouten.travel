I went to Santa Fe for an Adobe-sponsored event this past week.

<!-- more -->

I was working with three other Adobe people helping to teach photography instructors from some of the country's top photography schools about Lightroom and Photoshop. Oh, and there was some good photography there, too.

A big day in our trip was a visit to a ranch where Western movies are made:

**2021 Update:** This is not the same ranch where the terrible Alec Baldwin incident occurred, but it is very near by.
