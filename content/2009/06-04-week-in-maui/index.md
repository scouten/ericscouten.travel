We spent this last week enjoying Mau'i with good friends and family.

The highlights of this trip were an attempted trip to Hana (cut short because we got a late start and then ran into road construction) and enjoying the beautiful sunsets from our resort in Ka’anapali.

Found this fun jewelry shop on a lonely road on north Maui and I just had to stop.

P.S. Yes, I know it should be "Smile You're in Maui."

The sign says “Narrow winding road next 8 miles.” And it was. This is one of the wider portions, where it's something like 1½ lanes.

I love little roads like this.

... Kahakuloa. A small ocean village in north Maui. Maybe fifty people or so. Very quiet.

It takes miles of winding one-lane road to get here. There was great banana bread. Or so I heard. I wish I had stopped for some.

Love this juxtaposition of the Pacific Northwest and tropics.

{{ es_image(id="es-1448-113", title = "Coral Blocks") }}

These blocks are from a reconstruction of a fort built in Lahaina in 1832. The blocks were formed by cutting coral found about 120 feet offshore.

From the photowalk with Peter on our last day on Mau’i. I honestly have no idea what this plant it. Tara said at the time it looks sort of like a mouth (of what, I wonder?), thus the title.
