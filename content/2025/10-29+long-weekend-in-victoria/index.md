Lisa and I took a long weekend together in nearby Victoria, British Columbia.

On Thursday, we took a short road trip and a very small ferry ride.

Did I say small ferry? Yeah, I meant small. (Like maybe 20 cars?)

Now back in Victoria and ...

Wait ... what? Is that Darth Vader? Playing violin?

Apparently that's a thing here.

This place is a favorite of ours:

On Saturday, armed with some surprisingly nice weather, we took a longer road trip (~two hours) out to Port Renfrew and Botanical Beach Provincial Park and enjoyed a nice hike into the woods and onto the beach.
