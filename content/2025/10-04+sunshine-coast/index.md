I've long been curious about the so-called Sunshine Coast area to the northwest of Vancouver, British Columbia.

<!-- more -->

I decided to treat myself to a solo roadtrip for the weekend into British Columbia, where I spent two nights in a very nice AirBNB in Langley.

During the day between, I drove over to the Horseshoe Bay ferry terminal and took the 40-minute sailing up to Gibsons and the gateway to the Sunshine Coast. The scenery was stunning!

What did I do upon arrival? Drove to the very far end of the road. There's another ferry that carries route 101 onward to Saltery Bay and Powell River, but I didn't have time to make it there and back.

On the way back to Gibsons, I took some more time to see the sights.

I timed my return to Vancouver for the sunset hour. **So** worth it:

On Sunday morning, as I was heading back home, I enjoyed the foggy landscape after my morning coffee.
