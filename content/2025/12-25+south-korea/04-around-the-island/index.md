Today I hired a guide to show me around the interesting parts of the island.

<!-- more -->

We started in Hagåtña, the capital:

{{ es_cdn_image(id = "es-25c-8307", cdn_version = "v1", cdn_key = "img/v1/2025/12/es-25c-8307", caption = "Plaza de España, Hagåtña, Guam") }}

{{ es_cdn_image(id = "es-25c-8308", cdn_version = "v1", cdn_key = "img/v1/2025/12/es-25c-8308", caption = "Plaza de España, Hagåtña, Guam") }}

And then, from a nearby hill (once used for a fort), we could see the beach and resort area where we are staying:

After that, we circled the south part of the island and enjoyed various beaches and overlooks:

And closed with the view from Two Lovers' Point:

{{ es_cdn_image(id = "es-25c-8451", cdn_version = "v1", cdn_key = "img/v1/2025/12/es-25c-8451", caption = "Two Lovers’ Point, Tamuning, Guam") }}

{{ es_cdn_image(id = "es-25c-8458", cdn_version = "v1", cdn_key = "img/v1/2025/12/es-25c-8458", caption = "Two Lovers’ Point, Tamuning, Guam") }}

Oh, and one more thing, there a few fun Christmas decorations on a nearby street.

{{ es_cdn_image(id = "es-25c-8292", cdn_version = "v1", cdn_key = "img/v1/2025/12/es-25c-8292", caption = "Tumon, Guam") }}
