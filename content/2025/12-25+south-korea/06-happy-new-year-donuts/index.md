As planned, we returned to the core city this afternoon.

My daughter had scoped out a well-known vegan donut shop and insisted we go.

So. Very. Worth. It.

If you're ever in Seoul, you owe it to check out O.verte. Even if (like me) you're not vegan.

We did a bit of shopping in the Myeongdong before heading back to our hotel.

The new year will be here soon for us. Wherever and however you may celebrate, I wish you all the best as we transition into 2026.
