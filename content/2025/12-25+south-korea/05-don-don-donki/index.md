Our diversion to Guam came to a close today.

<!-- more -->

This morning we woke up to this gorgeous view over the ocean.

And before we left, we just _had_ to take in the cultural phenomenon that is Don Don Donki.

For the unfamiliar (I was, until DDD was pointed out to us by our first taxi driver in Guam), it's kind of miniature Walmart meets a comic-book version of Trader Joe's with a heavy Japanese flavor. (Apparently DDD is quite a chain in Japan.)

With that introduction, here is my take on Don Don Donki's store in Guam.

This one especially cracks me up: USA souvenirs, but the description is mostly in Japanese.

We're staying at an airport hotel in Incheon tonight and moving back into the city proper for our last bit of time in Seoul tomorrow.
