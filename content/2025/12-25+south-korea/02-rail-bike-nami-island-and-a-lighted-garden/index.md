For our first full day in South Korea, we booked a package tour that led us through a few fun adventures in the mountains to the east of Seoul.

We started with the [Gangchon Rail Park](https://railpark.co.kr/index_.php?lng=e), an abandoned rail line which was converted for use by rail bikes.

There are a few tunnels along this route and they made the most of the possibilities:

After the rail park, we moved on to [Nami Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namiseom), which is a small island converted into a tourist destination. Nami bills itself as an independent micronation (it's not, really), so we passed through "immigration" (i.e. ticket check) before a short ferry ride on to the island.

Nami is really a tourist venue, but as they go, it's relatively nicely decorated.

After this, it became dark, which made it the perfect time to visit the [Garden of Morning Calm](https://www.morningcalm.co.kr). It being winter, there are no naturally-blooming flowers, so the proprietors decided to throw a Christmas light party.

This post is dedicated to my mom, who really enjoys a good Christmas light display. Wish we could have taken you through this in person. Hopefully these pictures do it some semblance of justice:
