Today we ventured into the heart of the city and toured the literal high point of Seoul, the observation deck at Lotte World Tower.

<!-- more -->

This is a skyscraper among skyscrapers. The observation deck _begins_ on the 118th floor, a mere 485 meters / 1591 feet above ground level. And then goes up a few floors from that. Whee!

This is what it looks like from the ground:

Lotte wasted no effort in making a dramatic presentation of the view from the top.

Once the reveal happened, we had the chance to walk around and take our own photos. In case anyone doubts that Seoul is one of the most densely populated cities in the world, here is evidence.

And these views!

On the way back down, the elevator provided quite the show of its own:
