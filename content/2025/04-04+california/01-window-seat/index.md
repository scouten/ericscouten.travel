I'm in California to attend a conference in the Bay Area. I came down a few days early to (surprise, surprise) do a bit of exploring.

In a bit of a plot twist, I've skipped my usual trip to the Mendocino Coast and instead am spending the weekend near Monterey.

Today, though, is all about the window seat and I got some fun mountain views on the way south.

Love this "close up" of Mount Shasta! Close up is used sort of ironically; from what I can tell, I was 57 km / 35 miles west of the mountain when this was taken.

Looking forward to some fun adventures tomorrow!
