Yesterday, I [explored the west side of Pinnacles National Park](/2025/04-04+california/02-pinnacles-national-park-west-side/). Today, I made the longer trek to the east side of the park.

<!-- more -->

Though only a few miles as the crow (or maybe I should say condor) flies, it's an entirely different trip for us humans using cars to get to the east and west side of the park.

Despite being in a much more remote part of California, the east side is _far_ more popular. How remote, you might ask? Long before making the final turn into the park, I passed a sign stating, "Next services 75 miles."

I did a brief hike on the "Old Pinnacles Trail" and then moved to the main area starting from the Bear Gulch Day Use Area.

Once on trail from Bear Gulch, I began to see what the fuss was about.

The Bear Gulch _Cave_ Tail was a special treat. "Flashlights required," they said. And they weren't kidding.

The next photo may _look_ brightly lit, but let me assure you it was not. (This is an iPhone photo and I'm very impressed with how it did, given the need to hand-hold for most of a second inside the cave.)

Someone warned me on the way in that I should remove my hat (baseball cap) before entering the cave part of the trail because I'd likely hit my head on the ceiling. They were right about the part where I would eventually hit my head. But I'm glad I didn't actually remove my hat. The hat absorbed the impact gracefully; I don't think my bare skull would have done so well.

One last meticulously-built stairway and I was up and out of the caves:

The end result of this hike is arriving at the Bear Gulch Reservoir, a popular resting point for many day-hikers.

I decided not to back track through the cave on my way back, but rather to use the Rim and High Peaks trails. While "longer" in distance, it was _far_ easier to navigate. And it offered some nice scenery of its own.

All in all, a good day with some delightful hiking. So thankful we have such special places preserved in our National Park system.
