I'm staying this weekend near Monterey. I've long been curious about [Pinnacles National Park](https://www.nps.gov/pinn/index.htm), so I ventured out to explore the west side of the park today.

California State Route 146 was once envisioned to cross through the park. Fortunately, a generation ago, it was understood that the wilderness was more valuable that any road that might pass through it, so the road is (hopefully) permanently incomplete.

Given the low traffic volume, there are some stretches of it that are marked as "one lane road." I'd say it's more like 1Â½ lanes, but still ... it's a fun and very mellow drive.

A park like this is built to celebrate distinctive natural landscapes. There were, of course, many beautiful views on the hikes I took today. I'll let them speak for themselves:

Tomorrow I shall explore the east side of the park.
