Today we left the big city and headed up to visit some relatives of mine near the Canadian border in upstate New York.

We decided to take the [Empire Service train](https://www.amtrak.com/empire-service-train) to Albany, which made the first part of the trip out of the city much easier and faster than driving. I got seats on the Hudson River side of the train, which made for some really fun views.

In Albany, we picked up a rental car for the remainder of the trip. It was very rainy this afternoon, so we didn't stop for photos at all.
