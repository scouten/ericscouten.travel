Today my team hosted the third [Content Authenticity Summit](https://www.contentauthenticitysummit.com) on Roosevelt Island in New York City. I've written about the event [over on my dev blog](https://ericscouten.dev/2025/content-authenticity-summit/). After the event wound down, some of us went to a nearby rooftop lounge to celebrate with a cocktail. We got there just at dusk, which gave me the opportunity to take a few skyline photos.
