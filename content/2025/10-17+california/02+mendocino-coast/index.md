Mendocino is my happy place. I know nobody there, need to talk to nobody. I can recharge there.

This was probably my 20th visit in 30 years or so. And I expect to be back on a future trip to California.

Not so long ago (a few years, tops) taking this photo handheld would have been unthinkable with _any_ camera.

But on my way back from dinner, I just casually took this photo. Handheld for something like 4-5 seconds and only a tiny bit of post-processing in Lightroom afterwards. 😎

The modern iPhone is a *#($ing amazing camera.
