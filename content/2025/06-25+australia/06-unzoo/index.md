Now that we've rearranged our trip, we're enjoying one of our bonus days in Tasmania.

I started with an early-morning walk around the central business district.

The highlight of the day was a visit to the [Tasmanian Devil Unzoo](https://tasmaniandevilunzoo.com.au), an hour's drive east of Hobart.

In this zoo, you get to hang around with some very mellow kangaroos.

My daughter has long been fascinated by the irascible creatures known as Tasmanian devils, so it was fun for her to see them up close.

Not sure what was for lunch, but it didn't have much of a chance against the devil's jaws.

We took a coastal route back to Hobart and arrived just in time for dusk.

Looking forward to our next port of call tomorrow!
