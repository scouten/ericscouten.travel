The plan was to get an early start and make our way along the coast to a fun AirBNB located on a farm in rural Victoria.

I awoke early for a walk around the neighborhood where we were staying.

Which was all well and good, but then ...

_Ooh, shiny, there's an abandoned lighthouse nearby!_ We took a little detour in the morning. The photo ops were amazing ...

Oh, and ooh ... botanical gardens, too? Count me in!

We especially enjoyed the aptly-named scribble gum tree:

And then -- stop me if you've heard this one before -- the well-planned day turned into a very long slog. When we left the park, the Maps app projected a 5pm arrival, which was about sunset.

I began to fret about having to drive at night.

Food and bio break stops conspired to make it a much later night than planned. And, yes, there were a couple hours of un-fun night driving. We're safely at the farm now and it sounds and looks wonderful. Looking forward to exploring and sharing tomorrow.

But ... for now ... sleep calls!
