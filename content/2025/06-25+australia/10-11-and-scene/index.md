We've spent the last couple days of our time in Australia at a lovely resort in Noosa Heads. Most of yesterday was spent on some leisurely hikes around Noosa National Park and today we drove back to Brisbane.

We took a leisurely drive along the coast and arrived at our hotel at the Brisbane Airport just in time to see sunset over the airfield with a hint of a view of the central city:

This will probably be the last post for this trip. Tomorrow (Sunday) we take the long flight home. With the rebooking, we have comfortable seats, but not window seats.

Looking forward to sharing the next adventure soon!
