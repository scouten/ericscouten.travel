Bomb cyclone. Massive winter storm. Hurricane-like winds. Whatever you call it, there's a big storm headed for Australia's east coast in the next couple of days.

<!-- more -->

Formally called an [Australian east coast low](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_east_coast_low), there's a major storm developing off the east coast of Australia and the forecasts for Brisbane and Sydney (our next two destinations) look miserable.

I'm very thankful to my friends in Melbourne who tipped me off to this event early enough that we could adjust. I spent most of this morning reconfiguring our trip to avoid the worst of it.

We'll be staying in Tasmania two days longer than previously planned and then moving on to Brisbane after the storm clears. Sadly, we will be forgoing our previously-planned time in Sydney as it looks like the brunt of the storm will land there and the dismal weather will continue through the end of the week.

One last photo from a brief walk about Launceston this morning ...

... and then we drove down the main highway to Hobart, arriving just in time for sunset.

It's cold here in Hobart, but sunny and that works for us.
