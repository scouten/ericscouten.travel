We're on to Brisbane, our next destination, today. Our flight left in the early afternoon, so we did a bit of extra driving around the channel south of Hobart before driving to the airport.

We stopped briefly at a farmer's market / produce stand on our way.

At the airport, the local news was featuring stories about the bomb cyclone storm hitting the Sydney area.

A few last photos from Tasmania as we climbed out of Hobart:

As I said [a couple days ago](../05-storms-comin), I'm sad that we'll be missing out on Sydney, but I feel again that it was the right move. As if I needed another sign, the first announcement that I heard upon entering the Brisbane airport terminal was "if you're travelling to Sydney, we regret to inform you that your flight has been cancelled."
