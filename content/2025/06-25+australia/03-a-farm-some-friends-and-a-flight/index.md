I mentioned [yesterday](../02-the-long-coastal-road) that we arrived late in the evening at an AirBNB site that's on a farm in rural Victoria. We arrived too late to see much of the farm, so they sent a welcoming committee first thing in the morning. (We made very fast friends, as you can see!)

If you're ever in rural Victoria east of Melbourne, I highly recommend a stay at [The Blue Barn](https://www.airbnb.com.au/rooms/49276450). Here's a sample of what's in store for you from our walkabout in the morning:

Once in the city, we met some friends of mine, John and Jo, the principals of [Sezoo Digital](https://www.sezoo.digital), who I know from my work in digital identity for Content Authenticity.

After lunch, it was time to head to the airport for our next adventure: Tasmania! Looking forward to exploring and sharing more tomorrow.
