I've written here before that borders fascinate me. Today I explored a tiny [exclave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enclave_and_exclave#%22Practical%22_enclaves,_exclaves_and_inaccessible_districts) of the United States that -- for those of us without private planes or boats -- is reachable only by driving through the adjacent parts of Canada.

I had visited once before and it led to the easiest border crossing I've personally encountered. I showed up in a rental car with Washington plates, offered my passport to the agent. Without taking it, he just grunted and motioned me forward and into Point Roberts. This was in 1995, well before 9/11 and the general tightening of security and borders that ensued. Sadly, I did not take photos during that visit.

So I came back.

This time, Canada was very clear about the fact that I was choosing to leave Canada.

While waiting in line for US Customs, I had the opportunity to take a photo of one of the many monuments that mark the border between our two countries.

One of the first signs across the border welcomes you to "Little America."

Odd fact: Gas prices here are in US dollars per liter. Even accounting for the exchange rate, these prices were _much_ lower than in the adjoining part of Canada, so I suspect they do a good business in selling gas to their northern neighbors.

I drove over to the county park that marks what was once a lighthouse here. Now there is only a rather mundane metal structure holding a modernized beacon. No lighthouse pictures to be had here. ðŸ˜¢

But there was a nice walk on the blustery beach ...

Roosevelt Way is the northernmost street on the US side of the border. To my left are houses in Delta, British Columbia. And there were many signs telling me the correct way to find the border crossing.

There's another county park on the southeast side of the peninsula. I took a few minutes to walk along some trails there and capture photos looking back to the mainland.
