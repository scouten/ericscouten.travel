Earlier this week, we saw somebody wearing a baseball cap advertising [Hot Dog Johnny](https://hotdogjohnny.com) in the charmingly-named town of Buttzville, New Jersey.

<!-- more -->

So, d'uh, we _had_ to check it out. The dogs (sadly, not pictured here) and the fries that accompanied them were delicious. As was the drive (also not pictured here, for lack of safe places to stop along the way).

But we can say we've been to Hot Dog Johnny's, owned by the same family for more than 80 years, located in the sleepy (almost non-existent) village of Buttzville, New Jersey.

It was a long drive. And totally worth it.

Back in Ocean Grove, I went for a late night walk and found this home beautifully lit up. A fitting close to our time on the Jersey Shore.

Tomorrow we head home.
