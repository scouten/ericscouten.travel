Lisa and I arrived in New Jersey yesterday morning for a weeklong family visit.

We were on a red-eye from Seattle and it arrived many hours before we could check into our hotel, so we took a meandering "scenic" route by way of the Old Mine Road along the Delaware River to the Jersey Shore.

We're spending the week in Ocean Grove, the Methodist-Church owned town adjacent to Asbury Park. "God's Square Mile on the Jersey Shore," the signs say. Mostly that meant we had to cross over the bridge into Asbury Park to buy wine if we wanted it.

Here are a few scenes from the mostly-historic residential neighborhood around our hotel.

We are staying at the recently-remodeled [Hotel Albatross](https://hotelalbatross1881.com). Originally built in 1881, it was lovingly stripped to its bones and re-imagined as a modern hotel that still keeps its historic character. We later learned that it had just reopened a few weeks before our stay.
