**Hi, I'm Eric.**

I'm an avid world traveler, photographer, and digital storyteller.

I share new stories of my travels here and am gradually retelling old travel stories, either by moving them from other sites or crafting new articles about them.

I've been to [over 70 countries and territories around the world](/countries/) and am looking forward to seeing many more.

I am also [a software developer](https://ericscouten.dev) and [an explorer of my home state](https://146parks.blog).

I hope you enjoy following this or another of my blogs!
