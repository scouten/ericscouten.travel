This morning, I woke up early again to view more of Joshua Tree National Park. This time, I took the turn to Pinto Basin Road toward the Cottonwood Springs area and exited the park to the south toward Salton Sea.

<!-- more -->

There were _(you're shocked, I know)_ more rock formations along this route.

The famous Cholla Cactus Garden trail was closed for trail restoration, but some of the "garden" was accessible from the main road. They look so fuzzy and inviting, but I am told they are anything but soft and fuzzy. (I decided not to test that theory.)

I took a brief hike at the Cottonwood Spring area, which offered a small bit of oasis from the dry scrub of the surrounding desert.

After departing the park, I drove along Box Canyon Road toward the north shore of Salton Sea.

I spent almost five hours below sea level today, bottoming out at -66 m / -216 ft. And yet still breathing air.

So very odd ...

A few scenes from the north shore of Salton Sea: (The south / west shore wasn't exactly photogenic ðŸ¥².)

I'll be in Palm Springs for a day or two (mostly working, so don't expect much for photos) and then heading home.
