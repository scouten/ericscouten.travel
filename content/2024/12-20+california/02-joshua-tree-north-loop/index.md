I woke up early this morning to go explore [Joshua Tree National Park](https://www.nps.gov/jotr/index.htm). What a treat it was!

<!-- more -->

But, first ... sunrise!

{{ es_cdn_image(id = "es-4710-043", cdn_version = "v1", cdn_key = "img/v1/2024/12/es-4710-043", caption = "northeast of Joshua Tree, California") }}

{{ es_cdn_image(id = "es-4710-049", cdn_version = "v1", cdn_key = "img/v1/2024/12/es-4710-049", caption = "east of Joshua Tree, California") }}

The park ranger who sold me my entrance ticket said it was good that I was here early in the morning. "Things could get busy later in the day."

{{ es_cdn_image(id = "es-4709-003", cdn_version = "v1", cdn_key = "img/v1/2024/12/es-4709-003", caption = "Joshua Tree National Park, California") }}

{{ es_cdn_image(id = "es-4709-008", cdn_version = "v1", cdn_key = "img/v1/2024/12/es-4709-008", caption = "Joshua Tree National Park, California") }}

{{ es_cdn_image(id = "es-4710-058", cdn_version = "v1", cdn_key = "img/v1/2024/12/es-4710-058", caption = "Joshua Tree National Park, California") }}

Now here was a fun road sign ...

{{ es_cdn_image(id = "es-4710-107", cdn_version = "v1", cdn_key = "img/v1/2024/12/es-4710-107", caption = "Joshua Tree National Park, California") }}

... which told me two things:

1. Going up this road was going to be so very worth it.
2. It was, as the park ranger said, good that I was here early. (I passed this sign at 8am.)

Herewith, split rock. No idea how it got that name shrug ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è:

There was a good bit of hiking behind the namesake rock, though.

A few miles farther up the road I found Skull Rock ...

{{ es_cdn_image(id = "es-4710-124", cdn_version = "v1", cdn_key = "img/v1/2024/12/es-4710-124", caption = "Skull Rock, Joshua Tree National Park, California") }}

... and then the oddly-named but picturesque Hall of Horrors Area.

{{ es_cdn_image(id = "es-4710-130", cdn_version = "v1", cdn_key = "img/v1/2024/12/es-4710-130", caption = "Hall of Horrors Area, Joshua Tree National Park, California") }}

Keys View offered the opportunity to look down into the Salton Valley towards Palm Springs.

{{ es_cdn_image(id = "es-4710-155", cdn_version = "v1", cdn_key = "img/v1/2024/12/es-4710-155", caption = "Keys View, Joshua Tree National Park, California") }}

And, with that, the park did indeed start to get busier. I retreated back to where I'm staying for this weekend. The street signs are ... a bit informal here:

{{ es_cdn_image(id = "es-4710-162", cdn_version = "v1", cdn_key = "img/v1/2024/12/es-4710-162", caption = "northeast of Joshua Tree, California") }}

Sunset comes early this time of year (4:40pm).

{{ es_cdn_image(id = "es-4711-003", cdn_version = "v1", cdn_key = "img/v1/2024/12/es-4711-003", caption = "northeast of Joshua Tree, California") }}

Looking forward to exploring more of the park tomorrow!
