With most of my immediate family out of town on various travels of their own, I decided to treat myself to a few days in the desert of Southern California. I'm excited to check out [Joshua Tree National Park](https://www.nps.gov/jotr/index.htm) this weekend. Stay tuned!

Today was all about the logistics of travel, but I did get a few photos from my east-facing window seat on the way down.

I think my favorite is this sneak peak at Mount Rainier as we came though the top part of the cloud layer.

On our way down, I captured a few views of the desert scenery that I expect to explore over the weekend:
