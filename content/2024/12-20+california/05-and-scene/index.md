And now, it's time to go home.

Outside the Palm Springs airport, I found this bench painted in the form of a boarding pass and two suitcases:

{{ es_cdn_image(id = "es-4713-003", cdn_version = "v1", cdn_key = "img/v1/2024/12/es-4713-003", caption = "Palm Springs International Airport, Palm Springs, California") }}

And I kind of love that the post-security part of the airport is also outside:

{{ es_cdn_image(id = "es-4713-005", cdn_version = "v1", cdn_key = "img/v1/2024/12/es-4713-005", caption = "Palm Springs International Airport, Palm Springs, California") }}

{{ es_cdn_image(id = "es-4713-014", cdn_version = "v1", cdn_key = "img/v1/2024/12/es-4713-014", caption = "above Desert Hot Springs, California") }}

Love this view of the Tacoma Narrows bridges ...

{{ es_cdn_image(id = "es-4713-032", cdn_version = "v1", cdn_key = "img/v1/2024/12/es-4713-032", caption = "above Tacoma, Washington") }}

... and my former home on Bainbridge Island:

{{ es_cdn_image(id = "es-4713-045", cdn_version = "v1", cdn_key = "img/v1/2024/12/es-4713-045", caption = "above Seattle, Washington") }}

{{ es_cdn_image(id = "es-4713-053", cdn_version = "v1", cdn_key = "img/v1/2024/12/es-4713-053", caption = "above Seattle, Washington") }}
