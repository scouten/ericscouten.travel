For me, the appeal was yet another visit to Mendocino, probably my 15th or 20th over at least 30 years. (I was there [twice](/2023/04-18+california/35-36-on-california-coast/) [last year](/2023/06-20+summer-break/09-11-comforts-of-home/) alone!) For Lisa, the appeal was an opportunity to visit [Glass Beach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass_Beach_%28Fort_Bragg%2C_California%29) in nearby Fort Bragg.

Lisa's verdict, as a first-time visitor: _Being_ in Mendocino is wonderful. _Getting to_ Mendocino, not so wonderful. I probably erred in choosing the coastal route, which is ... long. And windy. (Note to self: Use the somewhat gentler Route 128 next time!)

We arrived on a cloudy evening and went for a walk along the coastal trails.

For all my times here, I had never been down on the beach below Mendocino. How did I let that happen?

Saturday brought blue skies, which inspired more exploring ...

... and lazing around and reading. I finished and quite enjoyed _[The Hunter](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/174156145-the-hunter),_ the latest novel from Tana French, shown here.

We arranged to go to Glass Beach, a short drive north from Mendocino, when there was a low tide on Saturday afternoon. Didn't see a lot of sizable glass, but we did see the remains of industrial waste. Until the mid-1960s, the people of Fort Bragg dumped all manner of household and industrial waste over the cliff into the ocean. The ocean responded by assimilating some of the items into what now appears to be molten iron or some kind of rock, resulting in some rather fascinating "sculptures" embedded into otherwise natural rockscapes.

I enjoyed the ebb and flow of waves in the tidal basins.

We did a brief exploration of Noyo Bay on our way out of Fort Bragg.

And then a bit of walking about on the coast when we got back into Mendocino.
