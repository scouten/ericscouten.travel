Where I live, we refer to Washington DC as "the other Washington." I'm not sure if that's meant as a compliment or not. Anyhow, Lisa's work and mine conspired to have us both on the East Coast this week, so we arranged to fly together so we could enjoy the weekends together even though our work required us to be in different cities.

Last night, we took the 4½-hour flight from Seattle to Washington.

We arrived later in the afternoon so there was just time for a quick tour of the Capitol Hill neighborhood before seeing about dinner.

I had a little time for a walking tour of the Capitol area this morning before heading out from Washington.
