Today I took the [Acela train](https://www.amtrak.com/acela-train) from Washington to New York City.

The trip began in Washington's beautifully-restored [Union Station](https://www.unionstationdc.com).

Acela claims a top speed of 241 km/h / 150mph and my track log suggests we got very close to that a few times. Despite the speed, I did manage to get a few nice views of the countryside from my window seat.
