Today was our last full day on the East Coast. We met with a favorite cousin of Lisa's for lunch in Clifton, Virginia, where I (the newbie to the family) was very warmly welcomed.

After lunch, Lisa and I walked around the village of Clifton a bit before setting forth on an adventure of our own.

It started raining a bit, so we decided to hop in the car and go exploring. We wound up in Harpers Ferry, West Virginia, where we explored some of the ruins of an old mill. Later (not pictured), we enjoyed some music before heading back to our hotel in Fairfax.
