Lisa suggested I explore [Roosevelt Island](https://www.nyctourism.com/new-york/manhattan/roosevelt-island/) while I was in NYC. Today is my last day in the city and I made some time before heading out to do so. I found an island that was clean and quiet and mostly residential, with some great views across the East River to the larger parts of the city:

On the edge of Roosevelt State Park sits an abandoned hospital once used to isolate smallpox patients. Today it has been taken over by lilacs:

Ostensibly I was there to check out a recently-planted [pocket forest](https://rioc.ny.gov/CivicAlerts.aspx?AID=399). Pocket forests are densely-planted forests of native tree species, which provide habitat for plants, birds, and other animals. This one had just been planted:
