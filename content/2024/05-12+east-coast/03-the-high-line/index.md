My work has me staying in a hotel in the Meatpacking District of New York this week. When I asked for walking directions from Penn Station to my hotel, I wound up on [the High Line](https://www.thehighline.org/), which is an elevated railway converted into a public park and walkway space.

I had read about the High Line a year or two ago and thought it was a neat experiment. Even more fun to be serendipitously routed on it.

Needless to say, it took quite a bit longer than my phone estimated for me to walk the distance because I was stopping frequently for photos. Here are some highlights:
