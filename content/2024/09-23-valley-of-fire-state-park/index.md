Lisa and I are in Las Vegas for a few days while she attends a conference. We had a bit of extra time this morning, so we visited [Valley of Fire State Park](https://parks.nv.gov/parks/valley-of-fire), about an hour north of the city.

This park protects a harsh but very scenic landscape made largely of bright red sandstone that has been shaped into fantastical landscapes.

They weren't kidding about the heat. When we entered the park, it was 37°C / 98°F and it kept going from there. For that reason, we limited our ventures to what we could see from our car and short hikes from there.

Even so, we got to see quite a variety of landscapes.
