The _plan_ was to find a nice trail or a sunny beach and go for a hike. Now ... if you've followed this blog for long, you know that any post that starts with "the plan was" invariably leads somewhere else.

<!-- more -->

And so it was today.

Several trails that appeared on AllTrails and the like turned out to have been lost to development (which is _everywhere_ here these days). And finding parking near a beach, even mid-day on a Thursday ... _es imposible._

We wound up driving over to San José (which will form a later part of the trip) and exploring the marina area to the east of the estuary. Lisa had stayed in this neighborhood on a past visit to Baja and wanted to see how things had changed. (A lot, it turns out.)

One thing that was new was this statue, named _El Rey Pescador_ (The Fisher King), on the way into the newly-developed area:

After several more attempts to find trails and beaches, we found a relatively quiet beach near Migriño, about 20 minutes north of Cabo. By then, though, it was windy and quite cloudy. That made for some fun ocean-scapes, but not the warm beach experience we were after. Ah well.

Before watching this video, I suggest turning down the volume. (Someday I shall learn how to avoid wind noise!)

Better luck _mañana?_
