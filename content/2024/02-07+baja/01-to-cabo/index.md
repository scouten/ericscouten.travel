Most of us who live in the Pacific Northwest find that there's eventually a time when you gotta get out of town and find some sun and warmth for a few days. Lisa and I hit that point recently and so we booked ourselves a trip to the Baja Peninsula in Mexico.

I'm writing this having now returned home and taken some time to sift through the photos and other notes from the trip. We had a wonderful time and I'm looking forward to sharing more of the trip with you all soon.

Part the first is our journey from Seattle to Cabo last Wednesday (the 7th) and a few explorations walking around Cabo in the first few days.

I had the window seat on the way down and had a good laugh when I looked out the window and recognized part of the route near Carson City, Nevada, that my daughter and I had taken during our travels last summer. (See [Summer Break Days 7 and 8](/2023/06-20+summer-break/07-08-san-francisco/#map).)

But enough about snow ...fast forward a couple more hours and I had a great view of [Isla del Carmen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isla_del_Carmen_(Baja_California)) a large island that is now mostly protected as a nature preserve.

## Lodging: The Oliver Cabo

We stayed for four nights at [The Spa Suite of the Oliver Cabo](https://www.covetedstays.com/rentals/spa-suite-a-unique-cabo-oasis-at-the-oliver), a small boutique hotel in the foothills just outside of the main downtown area of Cabo.

It's quirky and cute. Our favorite parts were the views over the city and the fact that it was well enough away from the touristy marina area that we didn't have to listen to the over-loud music.

## Walking around Cabo

It was about 2km (slightly more than one mile) from our AirBNB to the downtown area and we walked it almost every day. Here are a few of the things we saw along the way:

## Fish Therapy

Content warning: Some people might find the idea of fish nibbling at someone's feet unappealing. If you are such, you might want to not finish this article.

We gave it a whirl and enjoyed it! It's definitely a unique experience.

## Your Inner Voice

Saw this written on a wall near where we were staying. I think it translates as: “Your inner voice – be quiet and listen to it.” Advice I quite agree with ...
