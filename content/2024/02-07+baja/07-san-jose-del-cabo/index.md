We wrapped up our time in Baja with three nights in San José del Cabo. While Cabo San Lucas (a 30-minute drive away) is the well-known resort destination and party city, San José del Cabo is a much calmer, artsy place. (Much more our speed, really.)

We stayed on the edge of the arts district and we wound up spending pretty much all of our time here was spent walking through that district.
