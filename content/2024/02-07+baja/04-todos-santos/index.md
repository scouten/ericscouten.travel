This morning, we had one last breakfast in Cabo and headed north to the historic/arts community of Todos Santos. Both of us had been here before and we were eager to make this part of our trip.

<!-- more -->

Unlike Cabo, which we felt was overrun by noisy tourists, we found Todos Santos delightful and fun. They, of course, have their tourist-oriented markets and restaurants, but the feel was much more relaxed.

We walked around the historic central district for a while. A few views along the way:
