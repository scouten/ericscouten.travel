My main reason for being in Berlin was to present on the work of the [Content Authenticity Initiative](https://contentauthenticity.org) to my fellow digital identity professionals. My slot was on Wednesday after the lunch break.

Being a one-time theatre and stage geek, I decided to see if I could go "backstage" during the lunch intermission. Ostensibly it was to make sure my slide deck was in order (good thing I did - there were some last-minute repairs to be made!), but also I wanted to ogle the impressive set of technology they'd assembled to produce the event.

Backstage, about to go on ...

And a few photos during my presentation, captured by my friend Judith Fleenor, executive director of the [Trust Over IP Foundation](https://trustoverip.org):

## Spree River Tour

The conference organizers invited speakers and sponsors on a two-hour river cruise on Wednesday night. Here's the boat that we were soon to board:

It rained in the early part of the tour, but that conveniently coincided with the dinner service. I took a moment (as a few others did) to catch some fresh air once the rains ended.

The gloomy weather did not at all dampen Berliners' enthusiasm for getting out and enjoying themselves!

And then dusk came, the rains ended, and there were beautiful city/river views to be had:

## Trust Over IP Dinner

Several members of the [Trust Over IP Foundation](https://trustoverip.org) were attending the conference from all corners of the world, so we arranged to meet for dinner on Thursday night. The venue was the delightful [Zur Letzten Instanz](https://zurletzteninstanz.com/), which has been a restaurant in one form or another since 1621!

I wish I had been a true foodie and captured some of the delightful food they served us.

## And Scene ...

One more panel appearance on Friday morning ...

... and then it was time to head back home.

I drove myself from Berlin to Frankfurt on Friday night, but wound up with little time for photos as things were starting to get late.

What I will say is that the rolling hills _around_ Frankfurt were absolutely amazing. I wish that circumstances had permitted some time to stop and take sunset photos. They would have been ... _chef's kiss!_

File under: Places to come back to.

I didn't have a window seat on my flight back to Seattle on Saturday, so nothing to share from there other than that the Lufthansa Premium Economy experience was quite nice. The Frankfurt Airport experience ... not so much.

Thank you for following along!
