Today I drove from Bratislava to Warsaw. I took a detour through some of the mountainous regions on the Slovak/Czech border and was rewarded with some excellent scenery. To wit:

But first ... the hotel where I was staying in Bratislava:

And a couple of food-related posts. This sign reads a bit badly in English, but I'm told that in Slovak it means "constant menu."

And this ... reminds me of some place I've heard of before. I just _can't_ think of what!

A bit of road-sign humor. In the European road signage system, a red circle with a number in it indicates either a speed limit or (if placed on a vehicle) the maximum speed that that vehicle can attain. Somebody here is _very_ optimistic about their bicycle, saying that it can attain 80 km/h / 50 mph.

As I got farther north in Slovakia, things started to get more interesting. Here is a small village where I left the main road for a few minutes ...

Once I arrived in Warsaw, the hotel offered a "palace view." Just a little "palace:"
