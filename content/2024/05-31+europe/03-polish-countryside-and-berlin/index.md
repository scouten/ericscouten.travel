On Day 3 of this trip, it was time to head to Berlin. I slept in a bit, which left only a little time for exploring along the way.

The Fernsehturm (TV Tower) was built during the Communist era to broadcast radio and TV signals throughout Eastern Germany. Today it is a popular tourist attraction with a restaurant that offers panoramic views of the entire city. (Sadly, I didn't have time to go.)

Looking forward to the next few days at the [European Identity Conference](https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024)!
