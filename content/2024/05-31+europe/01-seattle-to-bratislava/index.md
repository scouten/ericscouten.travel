I'm headed to Berlin this week for the [2024 European Identity Conference](https://www.kuppingercole.com/events/eic2024). I left a couple days early so I could go exploring a bit.

At the last minute, I changed my flight to leave on Friday instead of Saturday and to arrive in Munich instead of Frankfurt.

Little did I know that change of plans would lead to me being on the first-ever direct commercial flight from Seattle to Munich. There was a little bit of a party at the gate to celebrate the new route:

On board, we were given commerative cookies ...

... and a water-cannon sendoff as we pushed back!

I had a window seat, which gave me some nice views of the Canadian Rockies along the way.

On my [countries-visited list](/countries), I've counted Slovakia and Poland from a trip in 2013, but the reality is that in those trips I barely crossed the border. My goal in this trip was to see much more of those two countries.

Once on the ground in Munich, I got a rental car and drove a few hours east to the Slovakian capital of Bratislava. Most of my time was spent on the autobahn in Germany and Austria, but I did venture off onto some side roads here and there and capture a few scenes from this cloudy/rainy day:

I arrived a bit after dark in Bratislava, but took some time to go out for a nightcap and walk around the area right next to my hotel.
