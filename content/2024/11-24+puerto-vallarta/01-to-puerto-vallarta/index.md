It's Thanksgiving Week. Lisa and I are taking a moment to ourselves and enjoying the warmth and sunshine that's available a few hours' flight to our south on Mexico's Pacific Coast.

We're staying for the week at the Vidanta resort just outside of Puerto Vallarta. It's maybe a bit more on the luxury resort side of things than our typical taste, but what the heck ... we'll enjoy it while we're here.

We made fast friends with the grackles that were all too eager to find us and eat our table scraps:

The nightlife at the resort was much fun. We especially enjoyed the sand animation as performed by this artist one evening:
