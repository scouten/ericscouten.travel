We've rented a car for a few days to explore beyond the bounds of our resort for a bit.

We had heard some good things about Sayulita a bit to our north. Aside from a brief bovine traffic jam, the driving there was pretty smooth.

We stopped in Sayulita to explore a bit, walk along the beach, and have some lunch.

The way back got a bit ... interesting. The main road (Mexican route 200D) is a toll road requiring exact change, which in this age of debit cards, we didn't have. What few ATMs we encountered offered only US dollars. Not helpful. So we plotted an alternate route back.

How bad can the _Camino Viejo a Puerto Vallarta_ (old road) be? It turned out to be very nicely paved and not very much used.

Oh, ummm ... did I say this road was "very nicely paved?"

About that ...

Turns out the _viejo_ part of the name was spot on.

But, what the heck? In for a dime, in for a dollar, right? We enjoyed the ride, even if it was rustic and slow.

I wish I had caught a picture of our car. It was spectacularly dusty when we came back.

Lisa says we should consider renting a Jeep or some other four-wheel-drive car when we travel abroad in future.
