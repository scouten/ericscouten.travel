Thanksgiving isn't exactly a major holiday in Mexico, but we managed to find some ways to enjoy our traditions while away.

We started by returning to the _malecón_ (boardwalk) to do some shopping and sightseeing.

After an afternoon _siesta,_ we drove up the road a little bit to the coastal town of Bucerías. We did a bit of sightseeing along the beach as we had arrived too early for our Thanksgiving dinner.

A local friend suggested we should have dinner at [Sandrina’s Restaurant](https://sandrinas.com) just up the road in Bucerías. It's a Greek restaurant run by a Canadian expat couple, but they served up a very fine turkey dinner for Lisa and a similarly well-prepared Greek dinner for me.
