As I mentioned yesterday, Lisa and I are taking a few days in Las Vegas for a conference. For dinner tonight, we ventured away from the Strip to check out the [Fremont Street Experience](https://www.visitlasvegas.com/listing/fremont-street-experience/35013/), which is a pedestrian mall in a more historic part of the city.

It's kind of fascinating. A few blocks of the "experience" are a walkway covered by enormous video displays on which they play all kinds of effects and videos timed to the music that is playing.

We ventured a few blocks east of the "experience" and found dinner at [The Mona Rosa](https://www.lamonarosalv.com) (the pink monkey), an excellent Mexican restaurant just off the strip.
