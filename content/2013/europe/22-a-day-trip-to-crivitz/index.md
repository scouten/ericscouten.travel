Last weekend, [coming back from Berlin](../15-quick-weekend-in-berlin/), we took a detour through the town of Crivitz.

<!-- more -->

We weren't able to stop then, but I bookmarked it for a future visit. This morning, I had some time to myself, so I made the trek back to Crivitz with camera gear in tow.

This last scene from Crivitz is a rusty sign reading _"Auffahrt zur Mühle,"_ or "road to the mill."

A footnote from the way to Crivitz: Yes, sometimes the autobahn _does_ have speed limits. What I love is that they often tell you why. In this case _(straßen-schäden),_ it means there is road damage ahead. There was. And then, as soon as the road improved, I saw a “cancel speed limit” sign.
