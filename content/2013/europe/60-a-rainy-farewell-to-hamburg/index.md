Farewell, Hamburg, it has been very good getting to know you.

Hamburg chose to give me a Seattle-style sendoff on my last full day of work there this summer. Hereâ€™s the view across the Elbe to the industrial area on the south side of the river.

And a couple other photos from the neighborhood before we go.
