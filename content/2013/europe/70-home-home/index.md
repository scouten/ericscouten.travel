Early this afternoon (London time), we got in a big metal bird and chased the sun for almost half a day.

We've had a great time and built some good things while here in Europe (for those who missed it, the core reason for being here was a temporary work assignment for me), but it's good to now actually be at home. Or "home home" as we would call it when talking to our daughter to differentiate it from our short-term home(s) in Germany.

Very much looking forward to returning to our normal routines at home. And this view ...

P.S. fun travel achievement unlocked: I bought a Starbucks drink in London this morning. And redeemed the Treat Receipt for an iced latte in Seattle this afternoon!
