I've arranged to work extra-remotely this summer. Adobe has kindly arranged for me to work with a team from its office in Hamburg, Germany, and for my family to tag along.

Last weekend, we made the long flight over from Seattle to Hamburg, and got ourselves settled in before the work week began.

This is the view from where I'm sitting in the Hamburg office. (OK, I have to look over one of my colleague's desks to see this, but still ...)

And this is just part of my (walking) commute home. Not bad, eh?

{{ es_cdn_image(id = "es-2368-004", cdn_version = "v1", cdn_key = "img/v1/2013/06/es-2368-004", caption = "Altona, Hamburg, Germany") }}

This idyllic walk was interrupted a few minutes later by some crows (?) or magpies (?) that were _very_ upset that I was invading their turf. They started dive bombing me until I crossed the street and walked on the "normal" sidewalk.

We've just booked a weekend getaway to Copenhagen and Malmo. A mere 5-hour drive (with ferry!) from here. Looking forward to sharing those stories!
