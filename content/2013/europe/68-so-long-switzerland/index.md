So long Switzerland, it was very nice to get to know you. We drove from Lugano to Zurich this morning. I commented while we were driving that I could spend a day in each of the little valleys just soaking in the beauty and taking photos that I would love to have.

Unfortunately, there are almost no photos from this trip as we had a plane to catch.

We are now in London (very near Parliament!) for our last two days and then back to home and our normal routine.
