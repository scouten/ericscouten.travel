Our first weekend in Germany and what do we do? We leave and go for a weekend vacation to Copenhagen. Just to make things extra spicy, we crossed one more border and found lodging in Malmö, Sweden.

We stopped for a moment in downtown Lübeck for lunch on the way.

And then – just like home! – it was time to board a ferry for the crossing into Denmark.

These two boats were similar to the one we were on:

We paid for upgraded space on the ferry, which wound up meaning we were first off the boat. It also meant we got an up-close view as we were approaching the terminal in Denmark.

One quick walk around town and then it was time to settle in for the night.
