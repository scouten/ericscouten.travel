There is something very charming about walkable European cities.

<!-- more -->

This is our last weekend in Germany before we start to explore some other parts of Europe and head home.

A friend recommended we check out the town of Münster and so we are making a short weekend trip out of it.

We mostly walked around and enjoyed the town, but there are a few photos from our walkabout.
