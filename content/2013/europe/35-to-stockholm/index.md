We're celebrating the July 4 long weekend in classic all-American style ... with a big road trip. Except we went road tripping to Sweden.

A friend and former colleague recently moved to Stockholm so we decided to go visit him "while we're in the neighborhood."

On our way out of Hamburg yesterday, we saw this vehicle. I mean, I like cars that have wipers to keep the rear window cle ... wait, _what?_

We paid an extra €17 for a "VIP" ferry ticket. That meant we got to park at the very front of the boat. I call that winning. Here we are approaching the dock on the Denmark side:

Long couple of days on the road, but we got to see a few new places along the way.
