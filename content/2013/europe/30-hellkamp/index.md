We moved to a new neighborhood (EimsbÃ¼ttel) today. The title of this page might suggest it's a rough neighborhood, but it's actually quite nice.

This street, a few blocks away from us, seems like the perfect name for a horror movie.

## A Note from the Future (2024)

Normally when I bring things over from Facebook, as I have with this post, I don't copy over comments, but there were a few that I just have to include:

**SeÃ¡n M:** Surely any camping is hell. ðŸ˜‰

**Kris C:** This needs to be on my front door. Perfect description for my life with teens.

**Rod H:** Related: [Google Maps: Hellnar, Iceland](http://goo.gl/maps/j9oXx)

**Andreas W:** And then there's this small town "Fucking" in Austria that just patented their light beer (called "hell" in Germany). The result? See for yourself: [Fucking Hell](https://www.fucking-hell.de/en/).
