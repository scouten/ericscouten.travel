There is a centuries-old traditional market near my office that has run [every Sunday for centuries](https://www.hamburg-travel.com/see-explore/maritime-hamburg/fish-market/).

On summer Sundays, _Fischmarkt_ (fish market) spills out into the adjoining street for a large public market for produce, fish, knick-knacks, and who knows what else. Here's a bit of the hustle and bustle from yesterday's market:

I came back this (Monday) afternoon to capture the entrance to the market hall.

Love the fish sculptures in the doorway.

Oh, and right next door is Adobe's office in Hamburg:
